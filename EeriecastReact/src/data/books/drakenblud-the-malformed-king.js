      title: "Prologue",
      content: `When man has slain the last of its monsters, brought light to the last of the darkness, and brought safety to the furthest of lands, what then shall it become? Will it be contented with the peace it had fought so hard for? Or will it strive ever further, reaching for new heights from the top of the mountain? What if it reaches too far?

Will it fall back into the darkness and become the monsters long thought slain?

Vangress Emberlind, King of Lorn, Protector of the Peace, and Master of the Blud, was in a foul mood. Today should have been a joyous occasion. His second son, Ulrin, had just turned fifteen, making him a man grown. He was finally old enough to receive the gift of the Blud in a ceremony that would, both physically and traditionally, legitimize his royal standing. But for the first time since the founding of the kingdom, the ceremony had needed to be delayed.

“I’m sure it will be resolved soon,” his wife and queen, Ceanna, soothed as she walked beside him. “Even if we cannot locate the originals, the Maidens will send us a fresh supply within the month. A short delay will do Ulrin no harm.”

“Bah! Who cares about Ulrin!” Vangress growled. “This is about tradition and the reputation of the royal family. People are already whispering behind our backs, spreading rumors about Gerevin. What will they think when the news gets around about this?”

Ceanna stepped in front of him, arms crossed. “What do you mean, ‘who cares about Ulrin?’ He’s your son! You love him. Would you say the same about our other children?”

Their two youngest children, Tobias and Gabriella, stopped when their mother did and stood at her side. Their postures were straight, their hands were folded in front of them, their eyes were politely leveled. They were two perfectly behaved youths, a model son and daughter.

“No,” Vangress admitted. “You are right. I am sorry, I should not have spoken so.”

The queen relaxed her stance, her expression becoming one of concern. “What has gotten you so on edge? This is not like you.”

He stepped closer to her and spoke low so their children would not be able to hear. “This may go beyond a simple clerical error. That Drakenblud had already been through the final refinements for the ceremony and secured in the Chamber of Ascendance. You know that only a select few can access that chamber. If it was taken intentionally . . .”

“You believe the Drakenblud might have been used by someone else?” she asked. “By one of our most loyal?”

“Or supposedly loyal. And if there is a risk we have a Bludded enemy within our walls, then I need you all to stay safe until we are certain.”

Without waiting for a reply, he stepped around his wife and continued down the hall, gesturing for his family and their escort to follow.

The king’s mood was not lost on their staff. While Vangress was known to be a stern and perhaps overly serious man, it had been tempered by caution and kindness. It was unheard of for him to behave so rashly and aggressively. The situation must have been dire indeed, and they kept themselves alert to the potential danger.

The group ascended The Steps of Worth, past generations of portraits of the former rulers of Lorn, all having the distinctive white-golden locks and cinder-red eyes of the Emberlind family. At its zenith were the massive, gilded doors of the throne room. The doors were a foot thick, solid stone beneath the gold and silver embellishment, heavy enough that a dozen men could not push them open.

Only a Bludded member of the royal family could open the way. The king placed both of his hands on the door and pushed. His muscles pulsed, empowered by the Drakenblud that flowed through him. The stonework rumbled as the doors gave way.

They entered the throne room, the king’s escort quickly taking defensive positions on either side of the door and in front of the throne itself. It was a small group, far less than what would typically attend the royal family, and did not include any of their servants or attendants. Just a small group of those that the king considered beyond suspicion, which included Landis, his Minister and Chief Adviser, Gahwell, his Captain of the Guard, and his handpicked Royal Defenders.

“All business will be conducted out of the throne room today,” he instructed Landis. “Any matter not of critical importance to the kingdom will be tabled until a further date. For those with critical matters, they may only enter one at a time, unarmed, and must keep twice the traditional distance from the throne while speaking.”

“Yes, Your Majesty,” Landis replied, quickly jotting the king’s instructions down on a slip of parchment. “I shall spread the word.”

“And one more thing, Landis,” Vangress added as the minister turned to leave. “Send a reminder to my sons that they are expected in the throne room. Their presence is a command, not a request.”

“Yes, Your Majesty.” With a quick bow, Landis rushed to fulfill his orders.

Vangress sat on his throne and tried to wait, but impatience quickly got the better of him, and he got back up and started to pace. He was uneasy. More than that, he was agitated and couldn’t seem to find calm. Understandable, he thought, given the circumstances. Potential enemies everywhere—himself, his family, his rule at risk. Who wouldn’t he be agitated?

They should be safe here. Only one entrance to the throne room, and it could be sealed under an assault. Though perhaps it would be better to just invite their assailants in. If Gahwell and the guards didn’t kill them, he could show them personally the power of the royal Bludded.

He’d feel better once his sons arrived, he was sure. Gerevin, as heir to the throne, was already Bludded. He might spend most of his days locked away, but he had the gifts of the Emberlind family. Together, they could defeat any assailant, Bludded or not. Ulrin still needed to be protected. He was proficient with the sword, but that would not do him much good against a Bludded assassin.

As his thoughts turned to how he might more quickly retrieve Ulrin, Gahwell announced the arrival of the Royal Swordmaster, Solden. He strutted in, all confidence and bravado and a broad smile on that obnoxiously handsome face. Somehow, he seemed oblivious to the tension in the room.

“Your Highness,” Solden said, bowing not nearly deeply enough for someone of his station, in Vangress’s opinion. “I have seen the bridge secured, as you commanded. Quite a few unhappy faces, as you might imagine. Many nobles here for the ceremony were looking to leave now that it’s been delayed.”

“Nobody leaves,” Vangress commanded. “I will not risk the Drakenblud leaving the castle.”

“Of course, Your Highness. I understand completely. Might make things a little awkward come dinnertime. Hope there’s enough wine to go around. Maybe if they’re all drunk, they’ll forget they’re prisoners.”

Vangress growled under his breath. He had always tolerated the Swordmaster’s eccentricities and attitudes because he was so well respected and because Ulrin had formed such a close bond with him, but his patience was thin today. He was ready to break that handsome face, then see if he had anything clever to say.

No. Obnoxious as he was, at least he could be trusted, and trust was in short supply. The fool had been offered Drakenblud before, as fitting his station, and had refused. Said he didn’t want to “taint the pure skill required for his position” by becoming reliant on supranormal strength. There would be no reason for him to steal it now.

“Have you seen Ulrin?” Vangress asked. The prince was often at the Swordmaster’s heels.

“A couple of hours ago. He was disappointed about his ceremony, so I gave him some drills to help him take his mind off things. He’s probably still on the wall now, practicing his rapid stance swap.”

“Retrieve him at once and bring him to the throne room. And, Master Solden, keep your sword at the ready and your eyes open.”

The gravity in Vangress’s voice must have finally sunk in for Solden as his smile faded, replaced by a serious frown. “Yes, Your Highness. I’ll be back soon.” And with that, he took off sprinting from the throne room.

Vangress put a hand to his face and closed his eyes. All of this stress was giving him a throbbing headache. It beat at the back of his eyes, pulsing in time with his heartbeat. Each beat seemed to stoke his anger. When he caught whoever was responsible for all this, they would suffer greatly.

A hand on his shoulder startled him, and he spun rapidly, nearly striking his wife with his fist before he recognized her.

She stepped back, shocked at his aggression. “Vangress! You need to take a breath. It will be okay. Sit down and try to get control of yourself.”

He shook his head. “I just need some air. Stay close to the children.”

Behind the throne was a massive, fearsome skull with fangs the size of a grown man. It was the remains of the last dragon to threaten Lorn, slain by the ancestors of the Emberlind family. Its jaw was open and positioned as if it sought to devour the throne, while a massive spear was run through its eye socket and kept it pinned to the floor. It was meant to be a reminder to the royal family of what they had to accomplish to deserve their position and what challenges they were expected to overcome for their people.

Right now, it served as a massive pain in the way of his path to the balcony. He had to walk entirely around the side aisle in order to step outside.

He took a deep breath of the afternoon air, though it was not a pleasant one. It was warm and muggy, unusually so for this time of year. Combined with the crimson skies that were growing more frequent and increasingly dark, being outdoors was hardly preferable to being inside. One of those red skies loomed over the castle now, casting an eerie glow on the surroundings.

The view from the balcony was an impressive one. From here, he could see over the top of the walls, past the great crevasse and the bridge that crossed it, currently drawn up, over the round domes of the capital city, all the way to the fields beyond. It was a vista that usually brought Vangress a sense of comfort, of pride of that which he and his family had been entrusted. But as he looked out now at his lands, cloaked in a red shadow, he felt none of that.

Instead, it was just annoyance. How much had he done for them? How much had he sacrificed? He had spent his entire life in service of his people. And yet all he ever got in return was more wants, more needs, more betrayals. The panicky fools had been sending representatives to the castle all month to seek an audience with him over the red sky, which some saw as an “ill omen.” The academics from the University insisted that the sky was nothing to be concerned with, just likely the result of a volcanic eruption in the neighboring county of Irimire, and should clear over time. Yet, his ungrateful and uneducated citizens could not be assured.

The pounding in his head grew worse. He clutched the railing with both of his hands and squeezed. The metal bent and warped from the power of his grip.

“Your Majesty,” a nasal voice called from behind him. Only Minister Landis had such a grating tone.

“You best be here to tell me you’ve brought my sons,” Vangress replied without turning away from the railing.

Landis cleared his throat nervously. “My apologies, Your Majesty. Prince Gerevin is again sequestered away within his laboratory and has the door tightly sealed. I was able to pass a message within, informing him you commanded his presence, but in his response, he claimed he was respectfully declining. I could gather the locksmith, if you so desire, though he may still resist.”

Vangress growled, and he pulled at the railing. With a piercing whine, the metal broke free, leaving him holding a twisted steel rod. He turned to face the minister, rage dominating his face.

“I sent you to perform a simple task, Landis!” he yelled. “Were my instructions unclear? Or are you just that incompetent?”

Landis sputtered. He had never been spoken to by the king this way. “No, Your Majesty, it was simply . . .”

“Simply what?” Vangress took a menacing step toward the minister. “Simply not doing your job? Or perhaps there is more to it than that?” Another step. “Perhaps you feign incompetence to hide your schemes. Perhaps you have been plotting. You are one of the few who has access to the Chamber of Ascension. Maybe you are the one who stole the Drakenblud, and now you are trying to keep my family apart, so your co-conspirators can eliminate us, one at a time!”

“What? No, no, of course not!” Landis stepped back, his eyes wide. “I would never! You know how the prince is! He is always in the lab! I did my best to—”

His pleas were cut off by a sickening crunch as a steel bar impacted the side of his skull. Vangress did not suppress his strength, causing Landis’s head to be completely pulverized. The body wobbled on its feet for just a moment before falling off the balcony through the fresh gap in the railing.

Vangress dropped the pipe and stood there for a few moments, breathing heavily. His head still throbbed, but he felt a sense of satisfaction that dulled the pain. Finally, he had taken action against the weak lickspittles of his kingdom. No longer would he be taken advantage of by those who claimed to serve him while secretly plotting his demise.

It began to rain. Strangely, the rain was crimson, like the sky. Vangress listened to it beat against the overhead roof for a minute, basking in the moment, before returning to the throne room.

As he walked around the dragon skull and back toward the throne, he was surprised to see the looks he was getting from those gathered. Expressions of concern and . . . horror?

“What is it?” he demanded, spinning around to take in the room.

“Vangress . . .” Ceanna said, worry heavy in her voice. “Are you alright? You’re covered in . . .”

Vangress ran a hand across his face. It came back red. He hadn’t noticed at the time, but Landis had splatted his blood all across him when he died. One last act of defiance from the minister, Vangress supposed.

“It’s nothing,” Vangress insisted.

“What do you mean, nothing? You’re covered in blood!” Ceanna stepped toward him, then stopped suddenly. She glanced in the direction of the balcony. “What happened to Landis? He went out there after you.”

“That’s none of your concern.”

She put her hand over her mouth. “Vangress, what have you done?”

Vangress roared a riotous, furious howl. The guards were stunned and looked to Gahwell for guidance, but he was equally in shock. The children began to cry.

“Who do you think you are to question me?” Vangress prowled toward his wife. The pain in his head beat faster and faster. “I am the king! I do what needs to be done! You have no place in telling me my business!”

Gahwell raised a hand, ready to command the guards to defend the queen if need be. But he became distracted as the sounds of screams began to drift into the room. A first one, quickly joined by others, as something terrible was unfolding somewhere else in the castle.

Though something terrible was unfolding here as well.

“We need to get you to a physician, Vangress,” Ceanna pleaded. “You are not well.”

“I am so tired of you telling me what to do!” the king shouted. “You should have learned your place a long time ago. I am the king! I am the Bludded! I am a god in this land! But instead of worshippers, all I have is carpers! I will tolerate it no further!”

He struck out quickly, grabbing his wife by the throat with one hand and lifting her off the ground.

“Vangress . . .” she cried in a gasping breath.

With a simple squeeze of his fingers, he snapped the woman’s frail neck. Her body dangled limply from his hand. She would question him no more.

The queen’s death snapped Gahwell to attention. Whatever was happening elsewhere in the castle could be no worse than what was happening here. “Get the children away from here!” he commanded as he drew his sword.

The king looked at him with the fury of raging fire. “You would try to take my children away from me? I would have expected better of you, Guard Captain, but I guess, in the end, you are just like all the others!”

Gahwell bravely stood between the king and the door as the others attempted to escort the children away. He was unsure how long he could last against a Bludded, but he would stall as long as he could.

Unfortunately, courage and nobility meant little in the face of true power. Vangress crossed the room in two mighty strides. Gahwell cut with his blade, but Vangress caught it with one hand and shattered it with his fingers. With the other, he shoved his fingers deep into the guard captain’s eye sockets. As Gahwell screamed, the king pulled, tearing the front of Gahwell’s skull and face from the rest of his head.

As Gahwell fell in a geyser of blood, Vangress turned toward his fleeing children. He would let no one else take them.

But before he could reach them, he was stopped by a sharp pain in his back. In defiance of his duty, one of the Royal Defenders had come up from behind Vangress when he was distracted and pierced him with his halberd. The point went straight through his back, out his chest, and dug into the floor, pinning him there.

Bludded or not, Vangress should be dead, and the Royal Defender who had struck him gave a brief shout of victory. But Vangress refused to die. He was the king, and he would not be slain by a peon.

The Drakenblud within him pulsed. He felt its power and influence wash over him, and he welcomed it. Through his torso, down his legs, up his arms. There was a series of cracks as his bones rapidly broke, twisted, and reformed. His body remolded itself into a new form, his true form, one no longer burdened by the frivolities of mortality.

His assailant gave a startled yelp and tried to run, but not fast enough. Vangress pulled the halberd from his chest and drove the point through the back of the Royal Defender’s skull, skewering him.

The children were nearly at the door, but they wouldn’t get away. He rushed after them, the Drakenblud in his veins morphing him further with each step. His body became mishappen and bulbous, his jaw distended, and his mouth became home to wicked fangs. He grew in size, and by the time he reached the other end of the room, he had more than doubled his original height.

The guards tried in vain to stop him, but they could no more slow him than the moon could slow the sun from rising. He left them in bloody piles on the floor and finally reached his targets as they reached the top of the steps. He could no longer remember why he was chasing them. That part of his mind had been given up to the Blud. All he knew was that he was hunting them, and that made them prey.

“Father, please,” the male child whispered.

The words were wasted on the hunter. What care does the wolf have for the bleating of the sheep?

The king took in a giant breath and then exhaled a plume of flame upon the children that quickly consumed them, melted their flesh, and blackened their bones, until nothing remained but two tiny, charred bodies.

The creature that had once been Vangress let out a mighty, triumphant roar. From his back sprouted a pair of wings, flesh and bone intertwining in a pattern reminiscent of dragon scale, if only as a twisted mockery. With them, he ascended, crashing through the ceiling and finally landing on the roof of the castle. The red rain poured down upon him, and he spread himself wide to accept it all.

Below, screams were now filling every hall as his brethren hunted the weak. But the storm was just beginning.

On that day, which would come to be known as The Bleeding, the former king would set the castle aflame, bringing an end to the royal dynasty of Lorn.

As the crimson rain fell, so did the world fall with it.`,

      title: "Chapter 3",
      content: `The Blood Rain had ceased. For now. The creatures that had once been men retreated from the small sliver of sunlight that pierced the crimson clouds. It was as safe a time to travel as was possible these days.

Ulrin grabbed his pack, double-checked the binding on his sword’s sheath, and then dared to come out of his shelter. Such as it was. The warehouse had offered little in terms of comfort and only a hard floor to sleep on, but it had been intact enough to provide suitable cover from the rain. The last thing Ulrin wanted was to have come all this way just to be done in by a wayward droplet.

Oniodon was once a center of culture and history for Lorn. People used to travel from all over the kingdom, and even from some of its neighbors, to take in the sights and learn about the land’s past. But now the city was silent, its once remarkable feats of architecture reduced to rubble, its brilliant white domes and marble pillars covered in layers of black sludge, as if the entire city had sprouted whole out of the muck. Where the road sloped, the red liquid that had rained down just an hour before trickled away and dissolved in the sunlight, leaving behind a fresh sheen of the dark filth.

Ulrin carefully took the alleys that ran adjacent to the main road while keeping himself hidden from any eyes that might be on the road itself. The Corrupted rarely stalked outside during the daylight, but it was better to remain cautious. He had been nearly ambushed enough times to know that, with Corrupted, every rule had its exceptions.

It was less than a mile between his shelter and his destination, but between his need for stealth and the roundabout path he took, the trip took him more than an hour. He was sweating heavily by the time he arrived and needed to find a spot in the shade to catch his breath and drink water. The air always grew hot and humid around the rains, even in the dead of winter, and the thick layers Ulrin wore made him even warmer. He couldn’t risk traveling any lighter, though. His padded gambeson offered him a degree of protection from blades and claws, the gray cloak covered vulnerable skin from stray crimson droplets, and the thick gloves and boots were essential for wading through the filth.

Not that those justifications made it any easier when he was sweating like a turkey before feast-day. He pulled a handkerchief and wiped his face.

The sound of scratching on stone caused him to freeze. It sounded like it was coming from nearby. His hand locked on the hilt of his sword, and he held his breath, waiting to be discovered by one of the creatures.

The sound faded. Whatever was scraping across the stone moved away from him. It seemed he had gone unnoticed. To be safe, he waited, completely still and silent, for at least ten more minutes.

Not wanting to waste any more time here than he needed to, he made a break from his cover and into the street. This last stretch would always be the most dangerous, as it forced him out in the open to approach a building that stood by itself in the middle of the square. He reached the narrow staircase and ducked low to conceal himself behind the banister.

He looked back to see if anything had noticed him. The street seemed clear. He needed to get inside quickly if he wanted to keep it that way.

The Grand Museum of Central Lorn loomed at the top of the staircase. The stone and marble structure had managed to avoid any of the exterior damage that had claimed much of the surrounding city, though its roof was covered in the same black filth.

Ulrin reached the door and gave it an experimental tug. It was sealed, as he had expected. Keeping himself low, he brought out his lockpicks from the inner pocket of his cloak. Back when he lived in the royal castle, he had taken to the hobby of getting into places he wasn’t supposed to be, but that had been for sneaking extra snacks or escaping his math tutors. His skill in picking locks had improved dramatically over the last few years out of necessity. It took him only a minute to turn the lock. He quickly cracked the door open, slipped silently inside, and sealed it behind him.

It was pitch black inside. The prism glass windows up near the ceiling that would have distributed sunlight throughout the museum had been coated entirely on the outside. Ulrin set his pack down and pulled from it his hooded lantern. Any light risked attracting unwanted attention, but he couldn’t wander blindly. At least with the lantern’s cover, he had some control over the direction and intensity of the light, reducing the risk slightly.

After lighting the lantern, he raised it up to illuminate the museum entry. He pulled down the hood of his cloak while slowly bringing the lantern around in an arc to take in his surroundings. Statues of the founders of Lorn flanked the entryway, where a small booth still bore a sign informing visitors that the admission fee was two copper royals. The walls beyond were lined with artwork, dating back to the days the dragons still flew. Pedestals bearing artifacts of historical import were arranged in rows along the walking paths.

It appeared unlikely that the Corrupted had ever made their way into the museum. They had a tendency to destroy works of art when they passed through an area. It was as if the very notions of art and history offended them, and they pursued their destruction with the same vigor with which they hunted humans. Ulrin would proceed with caution anyway, just in case.

As he passed through the rows of carefully curated relics, he wished he had paid more attention to the trip he had taken here with his mother. Queen Ceanna had been concerned that he spent all his time playing sports or practicing his swordplay and not nearly enough time in his studies. She had hoped the trip would instill in him a respect and interest in the kingdom’s history. Ulrin had childishly viewed it as a punishment and endeavored to sneak away from the tour whenever he could. His mother had been so disappointed with him.

He felt a surge of guilt and pain remembering it. How foolish he had been. How immature. What he wouldn’t give to have his mother beside him now, pointing to the various relics and lecturing him on the history they represented. He would hang on to every word and, when she finished, ask her to tell him more.

But that would not happen.

Fortunately, he was able to locate a sign that could point him where he needed to go, despite his lack of knowledge of the museum’s layout. The Dragonslayer exhibit was on the lower level, accessible from a staircase in the center of the museum.

He tried not to get distracted as he made his way deeper into the museum, but as his lantern revealed plaques that gave historical context to the relics on display, Ulrin’s curiosity and wistfulness forced him to stop and examine the pedestals.

A stone tablet was etched with orders issued to the Dragonslayers fighting on the front lines. In those days, you did not write anything on paper that you could not afford to lose due to the risk of it being caught in dragon fire. Important messages were sent on stone or on metal. The founding Codes of Law drafted upon the formal establishment of Lorn as a kingdom were written on steel in recognition of that tradition, though the last dragon had been slain by then. Ulrin wondered if they had survived the destruction of the castle.

The crown of the Emberlind dynasty sat underneath thick glass. It had been worn by his ancestors as the symbol of their office, with a plating forged from dragon scale as the display of the right to rule. During the Reformation, when the nobles lobbied for a greater say in the affairs of the government and a limiting of the powers of the royal family, the crown had been removed as a show of concession to some of the demands, replaced by the sigil rings that bore the mark of the Emberlind. The crown was retired to be a display piece in the museum.

A broken wheel sat in a place of distinction in the path between rooms. It was all that remained of a failed project to create a great mobile war platform that could move large weapons and troops across fields assaulted by flame and arrows. It had been a disaster, too heavy to move any distance in a reasonable time, particularly under fire. The entire platform had been destroyed in its first test run. The wheel had been put on display as a commemoration of the colossal failure.

The queen had spent extra time here, trying to instill the lesson that the wheel taught into the young Ulrin. “Our kingdom does not hide from its mistakes. We learn from them, grow from them, and move on as a stronger and wiser people. That is why we show no shame about our missteps. We display them proudly, as it shows how far we have come.”

Ulrin wondered what she would have to say about the mistakes that led the kingdom to its current state.

He forced himself to resist the next displays that stood between him and the central staircase. It wouldn’t do him any good to become overly obsessed with what was lost. It would just drive him into another state of melancholy. He needed to maintain his drive if he was going to accomplish his goal.

As he approached the staircase, his senses picked up the faint scent of smoke. Only one Corrupted Ulrin had ever encountered had possessed the ability to breathe fire. Smoke usually meant one thing: survivors.

There was always a strange mix of elation and concern when encountering other survivors. He might go weeks without seeing another living soul that still hung onto their humanity. Sometimes, he was concerned he might be the last one left, so finding others filled him with hope and the desire to hurry to them to cure his loneliness. But people could be just as dangerous as any creature. Desperate, starved, and nervous, they were just as likely to try to shank him for his boots as they were to welcome him in. He’d already been forced to draw his blade on more men than he cared to think about.

He took some of the soot from his lantern and ran it through his hair. The Emberlind family had distinctive blond hair, so light that it appeared white in certain illuminations. Through some unfortunate encounters, Ulrin had learned that this marked him as a target. Some of Lorn’s citizenry blamed the royal family for The Bleeding and were eager for any chance at revenge. To mitigate this risk, Ulrin kept his hair short and attempted to darken it with dirt and soot. Sadly, he had no similar solution for his family’s red eyes.

When he was ready, he lowered the hood on his lantern and silently descended the stairs. He stopped at the midway landing and peered over the banister.

The lower level had been turned into a makeshift camp. Tapestries and sacred cloths had been torn up and repurposed as crude tents. Displays and furniture had been arranged about the center to form a barricade between the camp and the stairs. Torch sconces had been lit along the walls to light the room. About a dozen people moved about the camp, shuffling at the slow amble of people with little energy and less will. One stood near the front of the camp, his eyes on the stairs, but his eyes could not pierce the darkness enough to see Ulrin hidden in the shadows.

Scanning the room, Ulrin was able to spot the object he had come all this way for. In a display the survivors had left unmolested, a clay model of a dragon head bore down on a life-sized mannequin of a Dragonslayer, posed to stand in staunch defiance against the beast. It was a heroic scene, meant to be an homage to the first men to stand in defiance of the dragons and one of the prides of the exhibit. What many wouldn’t know, without the benefit of a tour from a knowledgeable guide, was that the sword in the scene was a real one, not a recreation.

Silverlight. According to the legends Ulrin had dug up, its steel alloy had included a small amount of a strange, silvery liquid that had been discovered in a fallen star. The liquid became a metal-like solid when exposed to great heat. This made materials that included some of this liquid in their making heavily flame resistant. Its discovery, at a time when dragon fire was one of man’s greatest fears, was thought to be an omen that it was time to bring the fight back to the dragons. The liquid was called Glimmersteel, steel forged from the last light of a fallen star.

Only enough of the Glimmersteel had been retrieved to make a few items, even with caution and careful rationing of the material. Each of these items would become legendary in its own right and the centerpiece of Lorn lore for centuries to come.

In addition to its fire-resistant properties, Silverlight was said to be blessed with a blade that never dulled, was sharp enough to pierce the scales of the toughest dragons, and resilient enough to withstand the full force of a dragon’s bite. It was told that it was wielded by some of the greatest Dragonslayers of the time and contributed to the slaying of some of the greatest of the winged nightmares, such as Chondeoraes, the Black Scaled, and Baedrioss, Death’s Companion.

When researching the blade, it was hard to separate the facts from the legends. Many of the tales written about the time had been embellished over the centuries to create larger-than-life heroes and fill the histories with lessons on morality. Still, if only half of what Ulrin had read was true, it was an incredibly powerful tool and one which would aid him immensely in his mission.

If he could, he would have snuck around the camp, taken the sword, and been gone without making himself known. But the camp’s barricade of furniture was positioned in such a way that there was no way to the back of the room without going over it, which would expose him out in the open. The best he could do now was try to be diplomatic and hope he could get them to let him take the sword without any issues.

He loosened his sword in his sheath in case diplomacy failed.

The next steps he took with no attempts at stealth, instead ensuring each footstep resounded down into the room below. He didn’t want to be seen as someone sneaky who was trying to ambush or steal from them. He’d let them know he was coming and meet them on their terms.

The lookout quickly snapped to attention. He grabbed a halberd that was laid beside him and took a defensive stance. It was a nice weapon, with intricate carving along the shaft and additional flourishes along the hook to distinguish it from a commoner’s weapon. Ulrin recognized it as the weapon of Defenders, elite soldiers who served the nobility as bodyguards as well as enforcers when the need arose.

The way the lookout below held the weapon, it was clear that he was no Defender. More likely, he had salvaged it from the corpse of one. Ulrin made no judgments. You took what you needed to survive, and corpses no longer had any use for their weapons.

The other camp members gathered around the barricade as Ulrin descended the last few steps, finally coming into the light of the wall sconces as he reached the floor. He attempted to maintain a neutral posture, one that was non-threatening but that also didn’t make him appear weak. His hand kept away from his sword, but lingered close enough to quickly draw it if he needed to.

The lookout snarled at him. “How’d you get in here? Did you leave the door open for those creatures? Stop where you are! I swear, if you take one step closer—”

“Joce!” an older man, nearly bald except for a dusting of gray hair and a face lined from a hard life, barked at the lookout. “That’s enough. We have enough problems as is without you picking a fight with the first stranger we’ve seen in months.”

The one called Joce grumbled something, but he stood down. He kept the halberd in his hand, however, ready to be leveled at Ulrin again at one wrong move.

“I apologize, friend, for your rude welcome,” the older man said. “It has been quite a few sleepless nights lately, and everyone is on edge.”

“That’s the story everywhere these days,” Ulrin replied. “Everywhere there’re people left to tell stories, anyway. No offense taken.”

The older man nodded. He was seemingly the leader of the group based on how the others deferred to him. They looked at him now with tired and worried expressions. “I am Shanno. Can I inquire your name, stranger?”

“Maxwell.” The name of a friend of his from the old days. The name Ulrin might only cause trouble here.

“Well, Maxwell, I am pleased to see another face who has managed to survive this long. It brings hope that there may be others yet. Alas, I can be but a poor host to you in our current state. We are stretched to breaking on food and water and can offer you none. Warmth and trust are also in short supply. If you need a place to rest from your travels, you may stay on the main level for as long as you need, but I urge you to be on your way as soon as you are able.”

Brusque, to the point, but polite. Just a hint of threat behind the words. Effective for dealing with someone who might be feeling desperate and stupid. These survivors had chosen their leader well.

“I understand your situation. I am not here to cause trouble or take from your limited supplies. There is a sword in that display behind you. I have traveled a long way to retrieve it. As it seems you have not been making use of it, this should be of no inconvenience to you. Allow me to take the sword, and I will be on my way.”

Shanno scratched at the wisps of a beard on his chin as he looked back at the display Ulrin was pointing to. The narrowing of his eyes and the tightening of his lips gave away his thoughts. He had no idea there was anything of practical worth in the display, but if there was something valuable enough for someone to travel through the maddened lands in order to find it, it would be a shame to give up such an item without seeing a benefit that would aid their survival. Ulrin could read all this on his face and knew he needed to persuade the elder before unreachable demands were made.

“Look,” Ulrin began, “I know trust is short, but—”

“Quiet, you!” Joce exclaimed, cutting Ulrin’s argument short. “Why should we give you anything? Who do you think you are, coming down here uninvited, asking to take something that belongs to us? You’re lucky we don’t tackle you, strip you down, and then send you out nude to face the creatures!”

“That’s quite enough, Joce,” Shanno said. He looked to Ulrin with an unmistakable look of resolve, which did not bode well. “It is true. We were unaware of what we had and were making no use of it. But it does fall into the area we have claimed for ourselves, which gives us possession of it. If it is something that can aid us with our survival, we cannot simply give it away.”

“It won’t serve you as well as it will me,” Ulrin argued.

“Perhaps, but a weapon will serve any master that wields it. These are dangerous times, and we may yet have a need for such a weapon. But I will concede our immediate survival is more dependent on food, water, and medicine. If you can offer enough of such, I can grant you the sword in trade.”

This had been exactly what Ulrin had been afraid of. He held up his palms to show empty hands. “I’m afraid I travel light. I carry with me just enough to survive my journey and not an ounce more. Nor am I aware of any caches of supplies to which I could direct you. Passing through the city, all I encountered was fouled water and food that had long since rotted. I have nothing to offer but my gratitude.”

Shanno looked disappointed. “So, you would take from us but give nothing in return?”

“I only seek to take that which you have no use for. Indeed, I have nothing to give, but you will have lost nothing you already had. On the contrary, you only stand to lose if you decide to get between me and my objective.” He allowed the implied threat to hang in the air.

The elder furrowed his brow thoughtfully, taking in the stranger, his attire, his weapon, their odds, and the risks. He was a thoughtful fellow. Ulrin had to respect him, whatever their differences.

Joce, on the other hand, was hot-headed and uncontrolled. “Fuck you! You’re not taking anything but a spear to the gut!”

The younger man rushed at Ulrin despite a plea from the elder. His halberd was leveled to ram the tip through Ulrin’s stomach.

In one motion, Ulrin took one step forward, put himself in a basic sword-fighting form, and drew his blade. It was an unimpressive thing, particularly when compared to the Defender halberd coming at him. The gilded blade his father had commissioned just for him had been shattered years ago. This sword had been taken from the corpse of a common soldier and had been worn and chipped from being wielded against the Corrupted. In terms of weapons, he was outmatched.

In terms of skill, the difference was even greater. Joce’s reckless charge left him completely open, even with the additional reach the polearm provided.

With one stroke, Ulrin tipped the point of the halberd aside. With a second, he put the blade through Joce’s throat. Even worn as it was, it could still penetrate the soft, exposed flesh. Joce gave a gurgled shout, dropped the halberd, and clutched at his throat. There was nothing he could do to stop the deluge of blood pouring through his fingers, though. He stumbled for a moment, then fell dead in a rapidly expanding puddle of his own blood.

It saddened Ulrin to have to kill one of the few remaining survivors that Lorn had left, though he felt no guilt. One of the most important lessons he had needed to learn to survive in this world was that if someone intended to take your life, you needed to be prepared to take theirs.

There were cries and moans and shocked gasping from the gathered survivors. Some looked like they were ready to rush over the barricade and charge at Ulrin with whatever weapons they had at hand. Ulrin braced himself for the possibility that he would have to kill them all.

Shanno held out his arm, putting himself between Ulrin and the rest of the camp. His expression had darkened. Gone was the polite elder who would negotiate with a complete stranger. This was a protector who had lost one of his own and would do anything to save the rest.

“Bring the sword!” he commanded to those behind it. Then, to Ulrin, “You will take it, and you will leave and never return.”

One of the men in the camp grabbed the sword from the display and tossed it at Ulrin. He caught it by the handle. It was surprisingly light, given its length.

“Now, go!” Shanno barked. “And may the dragons bite at your heels for the rest of your days!”

It was as powerful a curse as anyone in Lorne could give. Ulrin couldn’t help but feel a true dragon might be a nice change of pace. At least then, the sides were clear, the objective was certain, and the fight was righteous. With what he was doing now, none of those things were certain.

But it was the only mission he had, the only thing left in his life he could try to accomplish. And so, he left the museum, the eyes of the enraged, the lost, and the dead, burning into his back, and continued on toward his self-assigned quest.

To return to the royal castle and kill the creature that had once been his father.`,

      title: "Chapter 4",
      content: `It was hard to believe it had been five years since The Bleeding. Since the dynasty of the Emberlind family came to an end, and madness took the throne of Lorn. Five years since he had lost his family, his home, and his birthright, all at once.

Well, five years, best he could figure. It was growing increasingly difficult to mark the passing of time. The hours of sunlight were growing shorter, and nights could stretch for days unbroken. Without predictable sunrises and sunsets, Ulrin had to estimate daybreak and nightfall.

In that time, he had developed a subconscious checklist of matters he had to see to in order to safely camp outdoors in the new world. The first was to find a spot on elevated ground with a decent view of the surrounding area. This was important for both defense, in case any creatures decided to wander close to his camp, as well as for scanning the horizon for crimson rainfall. If he could see the distinctive red curtain in the distance, he knew it would only be a matter of hours before the storm reached him. In that case, he needed to abandon his plans and find sufficient cover. Buildings and caves provided a higher risk of him encountering creatures or hostile survivors, but it was preferable to being caught in the rain and risking Corruption.

If the sky seemed clear, then he moved on to set up his defenses. He’d patrol the most likely paths up this camping spot and drop a scattering of coins. The gold royals no longer had any value as currency, but they were still useful as a tool. For some reason, the Corrupted had a habit of picking the coins up when they noticed them and rattling them in their hands. Sometimes, they would even fight one another for them. Perhaps it was a small holdover of their human memories, a fragment of themselves that remembered when the gold pieces were important to them. For Ulrin, the noise of jingling-coins-combating creatures served as a warning.

He’d then set as many obstacles as he could find in the direct path of his camp to discourage and slow any hunters. Ideally, his camping spot would be naturally defensible, but it was getting hard to be picky these days. Stones, logs, brambly plans, anything he could quickly and quietly move onto the paths. He would bring a few of the larger objects closer to the camp itself in case he needed something to take cover behind during an attack. All the while, he would be careful to cover his tracks to avoid being trailed.

Once he was confident that his campsite was secure, he would look over his supplies. Food and water needed to be checked for any signs of Corruption, tears in their containers, or any signs of changes in scent. Even a small amount of Corruption would require him to toss the entire container, however devastating that would be to his diet. Better to die from starvation than become one of those things. The rest of his stores also needed to be checked as well; in case any of his clothing, medicine, or tools got any of the corrupted blood on them, they would need to be carefully cleaned to avoid them accidentally touching his bare skin.

Only when these chores had been completed could he start to take his rest. A small fire could be made for cooking, but he’d have to keep the flames low and put it out as soon as it was no longer needed. He’d had a proper tent once but found that not only was it too heavy for speedy travel, but it delivered a false sense of security that allowed him to sleep too soundly, which was risky, so he abandoned it and now slept just in his bundle of furs. He’d wrap himself in the furs as he performed his final duties of the night: a check on the condition of his weapons.

Tonight, he had a new sword to look over. Silverlight was unlike any other sword he had ever handled. Length-wise, it was near in size to a two-handed longsword, but it weighed no more than a short sword. Its blade was also strangely thin, to the point where it appeared frail. In the light of his lantern, he could see a silvery pattern run down the blade. It appeared to flow like liquid, collecting as droplets near the edge, though nothing dripped from the blade.

Ulrin wasn’t sure how he would go about checking the condition of something like this, but he was able to confirm the blade was indeed sharp, the hilt was solid, and the sword kept together after a few practice swings. That would have to be good enough. It wouldn’t be until he was forced to use it that he would be able to confirm whether the sword even came close to living up to its legends.

He sure hoped it did, given the amount of effort it took to retrieve. Traversing Oniodon had been dangerous, to the extent that it bordered on foolish. Then there had been the whole incident with the survivors in the museum. He hoped Shanno was able to keep the rest of his group alive, though he knew, realistically, they would all be dead when they finally ran out of food, whether from starvation or from braving the city in search of supplies.

More than just justifying the excursion, Ulrin desperately needed the win. It sometimes felt like these last five years had just been a series of compounding failures for him.

After the fall of the castle and being forced to flee from his father, he thought he might rally the army, the populace, to retake it. That was when he learned the chaos was not just around the capital but had spread to every corner of Lorn and beyond.

Then he thought he might find some castle still standing, some fortress or outpost that had been sealed against the rain, with defenders who had held against the Corrupted. Surely with enough men, they could forge a safe haven for survivors and use it as a base of operations to retake the land. But the story was the same everywhere he went, every fortification and barracks he visited: slaughter, destruction, and hordes of Corrupted.

It was only after he had given up completely on the hope of somehow saving Lorn that he began to pursue a more attainable goal: slaying his father. It might accomplish little in the grand scheme of things, but at least he could have some matter of vengeance. For himself and for his family.

Though even with that goal, he had made little progress. The creature that had been King Vangress was incredibly, terrifyingly powerful. All of those who were Bludded before The Bleeding had become creatures far more powerful than the Corrupted, who had been turned by the rain or consumption. But even by those standards, his father was in a league of his own. Ulrin would stand no chance without an arsenal to even the odds.

Silverlight marked his first success in locating something valuable to the mission. But it was not enough on its own. Unfortunately, he was fast running out of options.

He took out his journal, a simple leather-bound tome that had been thoroughly worn by the elements. Here he chronicled where he had been and what he had found. In the early pages, he had been thorough, going into detail on the levels of destruction, the number of casualties he had seen, and what might still be salvaged. Oniodon wouldn’t get more than: “City overrun. Retrieved Silverlight. Nothing else to salvage. Hostile survivors in the museum.”

He flipped to the bookmarked page near the front of the book. On this page, he had hurriedly scrawled a list of locations of items with supposed mythical or magical properties which might suit his cause. It was the result of his research in the Library of Vel’Diel, which he had to make a sudden escape from when he was discovered by the former librarian creatures.

Most of the list was crossed off now. Some of the objects had turned out to be nothing more than historical fiction or exaggeration. Others had been looted by other survivors long before he had arrived, and their trails had already gone cold. A few were just simply not where they were supposed to be, and Ulrin did not know why. Perhaps the information in the library had been out of date.

Ulrin felt little satisfaction putting his first circle next to his notes on Silverlight. He had hoped, by this point, to be sitting on a considerable stockpile of Lorn’s most powerful relics. He looked up at his previous failures, trying to reason if there was anything he might have missed, any place that might be worth a second trip.

In the town of Icury, the church was supposed to have a Vial of Sacred Water that could cure any injury. According to the legend he’d read, just a drop of the Sacred Water was enough to fully restore a Dragonslayer whose body had been covered in deep burns. Whether this was true, Ulrin would never know, as the people of Icury had expended the vial in an attempt to treat those tainted by the Blood Rain. The only thing UIrin could say for sure was that they failed, and Icury now belonged to the Corrupted.

Ariosas had been home to a legendary line of armor forgers. For generations, they had been tasked with crafting the armor for the Royal Defenders, the guardians of the Emberlind family, and the Dragonwatch, the successor organization to the Dragonslayers tasked with being ready should the dragons return. Their family was supposed to have a stockpile of fireproof, crushproof armor able to withstand the piercing of a dragon’s fang. Apparently, their reputation was somewhat exaggerated, as Ariosas had been filled with bodies covered in armor that had been broken.

The Fortress at Eyrance had been tasked with watching the border with the neighboring country of Irimire. To aid in this, they were given a mystical-looking glass, capable of not only seeing across great distances but also revealing the hidden and obscured. Ulrin hoped it would make a powerful tool for scouting the royal castle. Instead, he learned that the garrison, or those of them that had survived The Bleeding, had taken the looking glass with them when they fled over the border, seeking safety in the lands beyond. They must have been sorely disappointed to learn that Irimire was in just as bad a state as Lorn.

One after another, he went through the list of disappointments and failures and found nothing worth revisiting. He knew he wouldn’t, but it didn’t make it any easier.

“Really no other choice, huh?” he said to himself. “Other than abandoning all of this, finding someplace to hole up, and waiting out the rest of my days.”

It was not the first time he floated the idea to himself. Each time, it seemed even more reckless not to take the easy option.

“But where would the fun be in that?”

No, he could not give up now. He had to keep moving forward, even if the path took him directly into the heart of the demon.

As it seemed it would. There was only one place left on his list he hadn’t checked yet: the Temple of the Blood Maidens.

He’d never been there himself. It was forbidden for any but the Maidens themselves to enter the temple, even royalty. He had heard some strange rumors about the kind of dark rituals that took place there, though, and it was not a place he would have wanted to visit if given a choice.

But it wasn’t the temple itself that he was afraid of. It was the approach to it.

The temple was deep within the Aspya Stretch, a territory Ulrin knew was swarming with Corrupted. To make matters worse, the temple itself was located on an islet in the middle of the Lucent Run, a fast-flowing river filled with sudden drops and rapids that made crossing by boat impossible. The only way onto the islet was via The Maiden’s Path, a footbridge that ran high over the river. A bridge that, as represented in the art Ulrin had seen, had no guardrails, no covering, and a path only wide enough for a single person at a time.

In an area so rich with Corrupted, being exposed in the open and left with no room to flee felt tantamount to suicide.

But if he could get to the temple, he might not only find some powerful tools to use against the Corrupted and his father, but also some of the answers he was looking for. The Blood Maidens were the only ones who truly knew the secrets of the Drakenblud. If anyone could tell him about the roots of The Bleeding, it was them. Perhaps even a way to stop everything.

He tried not to get his hopes up. There had been too many disappointments already. Plus, he still had to survive the journey.

His mind made up, he put out his lantern, said his prayers to anyone who was still listening, and then tried to rest for the journey ahead.

---

Ulrin awoke suddenly with a start. His hand went to his sword at his side as he leaped out of his furs and into a ready stance. Adrenaline pumping through him quickly cleared his grogginess and sharpened his senses. It was dark still, and even as honed as his night vision had become, he could barely see beyond the perimeter of the camp.

He tried to steady his breath as he tried to figure out what his subconscious had sensed that had forced him awake. Nothing immediately stood out to him. The camp was empty. The wind was still, and the surroundings were silent.

Just as he was beginning to think it must have just been the passing of some wild animal, he began to hear it. It was a low clacking sound, like someone gently tapping two sticks together. It came in short bursts, a few seconds of rapid clacking followed by silence.

The Blind. A type of Corrupted, one of the wandering varieties who hunted in the wilderness. As the name implied, they could not see, at least not in the typical sense. They navigated and stalked their prey using the sounds they emitted.

Ulrin dared to bend over and ignite his lantern. The light would not aid the Blind, but it would help him. Hopefully, the creature was not in a pack with another type of Corrupted, in which case Ulrin would have just made himself a target.

He listened closely to the clacking as it got closer. There was only ever one set, leading him to believe this was a lone creature. Not that he could relax. Even alone, a Corrupted was very dangerous. But it could also be his opportunity to test his new blade.

He took a spot at the edge of the camp, opposite of the direction the creature was coming from, held Silverlight up near his chest, and waited, remaining as still as his body would allow.

A few moments later, it appeared. The Blind was still mostly human in form. This particular one had clearly been a young man. Its greasy black hair fell in clumps around its face. What remained of its clothing was so soiled that it was impossible to tell its original design. Its face was swollen beyond recognition, resulting in its eyes being completely swollen shut. On the right of its face, the flesh protruded to form a disproportionately large ear. At the end of its hands, its fingers were twisted into long, brutally sharp claws.

It stepped into the camp and opened its mouth, giving off another short burst of its strange clanking sound. Ulrin remained completely still, not even daring to breathe.

The creature slowly crept further into the camp, bobbing its head about to listen for movement. Still holding his breath, Ulrin began to creep toward it. He was careful to remain on the opposite side of its ear. If it heard him, it would rush at him with inhuman speed and try to slash him open with its claws. Without his gambeson on, his flesh would tear quite easily.

He got within a single pace of his sword’s reach when the Blind suddenly turned toward him and let out a shriek. With a curse, Ulrin quickly lunged and slashed out with his blade.

Silverlight cut through the Blind as easily as it cut through the air. The Corrupted had skin as tough as leather, sometimes as hard to pierce as the strongest plate armor. Ulrin had broken a number of blades and cudgels in his battles with them. He was so surprised that his strike didn’t meet any noticeable resistance that he overextended himself and near went tumbling down directly atop the creature. He was able to right himself just in time to avoid being splattered by the spray of blood from the gaping wound across the Blind’s chest.

Ulrin retreated backward, and the creature lashed out, letting out a roar of pain and rage, but already it was weakening, slowing. It stumbled forward toward him but did not have the strength to keep up. With one last cry, it fell, its sickly blood pouring into the dirt.

He waited a minute to see if the noise had attracted other creatures. When things remained silent, he finally allowed himself to take a breath of relief.

Silverlight gleamed in the glow of the lantern. It was clean, with no sign of the dark blood that it should have been covered in. It was as if the silver river that ran through it washed away the Corruption.

Ulrin was amazed at its effectiveness. It seemed that not all legends were exaggerations. He felt a surge of pride for having finally recovered something so powerful. Maybe his mission had a chance after all.

But first, he had a river to cross.

He no longer felt that the camp was safe. Not that he would likely be able to get back to sleep after this encounter. Might as well get an early start on the next leg of his journey. Within minutes, his camp, such as it was, was packed, and Ulrin was off to the Temple of the Blood Maidens.`,

      title: "Chapter 5",
      content: `A bit of good fortune finally came to Ulrin as he reached the region of the Aspya Stretch. An entire day of true daylight without a red cloud in sight. He decided to make the most of it, choosing to brave a path that took him directly through the heart of the valley rather than the safer route around the outskirts. It saved him days of potential travel time, and he was able to reach the edge of the river as night fell.

Unfortunately, his good luck ended there. He had hoped to wait until the next daylight to approach and cross the bridge, but for the next three days, there wasn’t a single ray of sunshine.

Every day he delayed, his risk of encountering the Corrupted grew. The roar of the river provided him with some cover from the hunters, but it also made it hard for him to hear any of the creatures approach. He’d already had a few close calls and had lost a good portion of his supplies when he had to make a sudden escape from his camp due to a group of Crawlers stumbling upon it while he was making his preparations. Now he was low on food, operating on nearly no sleep, and one misstep from running into a horde of the bastards.

He couldn’t hold out any longer. He’d have to risk the bridge in the darkness. Hopefully, it was clear on the islet, and the temple had stocks that he could use to replenish his supplies.

It was only a short walk downriver from his latest camp to the foot of The Maiden’s Path. The bridge was every bit as terrifying as the artwork made it out to be. A set of narrow steps led up the walkway, which was elevated twenty feet over the surging river. Deep cracks ran through the stonework, and the whole thing looked like it could collapse at any moment.

The far end of the bridge was outside the range of his lantern, but he estimated it was 500 feet to the islet. He’d be completely exposed while up there, and given the state of the bridge, how narrow the walkway was, and the lack of railings, he would have to go slow and carefully. It was a lot of time for something to go wrong.

But if he lingered too long, it was a guarantee that some creature would be drawn to his lantern light. He took a deep breath, steeled his courage, and ascended the steps to the walkway.

The walkway seemed clear, and the only sound he could hear was the roaring of the river below. Despite that, some part of his survival instinct was tingling at the back of his head. He drew Silverlight in one hand and held the lantern out with the other as he took his first steps onto the path.

Years of crimson rain had left a slippery layer of black sludge across the walkway. With each step, he had to be careful with his footing to avoid sliding right off the bridge. The wind picked up, and he had to brace himself to keep his footing.

“I should have done more of Master Solden’s footwork exercises.”

The Swordmaster had always chided him for putting too much focus on his strikes and parries and not enough on his maneuvering. “A sword fight is won and lost in the feet. A casual observer’s eyes may be drawn to the clash of blades, but a master’s gaze watches the steps. Control your balance, spacing, and strides, and you will control the contest.”

For practice, Solden used to have Ulrin walk across narrow beams while avoiding strikes to his feet. Ulrin had always hated it. He loved the feel of a sword in his hand and the thrill of a duel, but the balance exercises had been dull and painful.

He was glad for them now as he again had to adjust his footing after a loose part of the stonework crumbled under his weight, sending a few bits of rock down into the river.

“I need to start bringing a broom with me,” he decided as his feet struggled to find purchase in the muck. “Sweep this shit out of my way. That’s what this world needs. Not a good swordsman, but a great janitor.”

The lantern swung back and forth as he swung his arms to correct his balance. It was difficult to keep it pointed straight in front of him. Maybe if he sheathed the sword, but something told him he needed to have it at the ready.

He reached the halfway point, the lantern light finally catching the end of the bridge and the edge of the islet. There was nothing between him and the end, and he began to hope that his feelings of danger had been the product of nerves.

Then he heard the scratches. It was faint, barely audible over the rush of the river. But that sound of claw digging into stone was one that he was highly attuned to. It was coming from below him. Or beside him. Or behind him. Perhaps all three.

He attempted to quicken his pace. If he got to the islet, at least he would have solid ground to fight on. The scratching sounds followed him. It was clear now that he was dealing with more than one creature, though he had no idea how many. The unseen creatures could be heard underneath the bridge, scrambling along its sides. They were stalking him, waiting for their moment to strike.

Almost to the end, hearing himself surrounded on all sides, Ulrin pushed for a last bit of speed to reach the descending stairs. As he did, his back foot slid, causing him to stumble and nearly lose his grip on the lantern.

This was the moment the hunters had been waiting for. In one bound, a Crawler leaped from the side of the bridge and directly in front of Ulrin, its claws already outstretched for a strike. Ulrin was barely able to step back in time to avoid being split open.

The Crawler’s body had been twisted to resemble that of a fleshy spider. It had become hunched and bulbous. Bony protrusions jutted out from its torso to form extra limbs. Each of these limbs ended in a hooked claw, which it could use to dig into surfaces to cling to sheer walls. Or to tear apart its prey.

It gave a hissing cry as it swung another of its claws at Ulrin. He raised Silverlight with the intention to parry the claw, which he knew to be as tough as the finest steel. But as the claw made contact with the blade, Silverlight effortlessly sank into the bone, resulting in the claw being severed from the creature’s limb. It shrieked and flailed its wounded limb in the air. Ulrin used the opportunity to plunge Silverlight into its head, splitting its skull neatly in two. The body wobbled and then fell from the bridge.

Ulrin didn’t have time to celebrate his victory. Behind him, he heard another of the creatures crawl onto the walkway. More scratching sounds, others climbing up from the sides. No way to fight them all here.

He rushed forward toward the end of the bridge, just in time to feel a claw scrape against his back. The gambeson protected him from the worst of the blow, though he felt the sting as his skin was scratched.

The creature crawled after him. Ulrin could hear it close on his heels. Its claws dug into the stone, ensuring it did not have the same trouble with balancing on the muck as Ulrin did. He could not afford to slow, taking the path at a full sprint and hoping his feet would find the balance for him.

Only a quarter of the bridge’s length remained when he felt a sharp pain in his leg that caused him to stumble. One of the Crawlers had reached up from the side of the bridge and sunk a claw into Ulrin’s lower leg just below the knee. The shock and pain forced Ulrin to stumble, and, in that moment, he was grabbed from behind by the creature chasing him. It wrapped the twisted remnants of its human fingers around the back of Ulrin’s cloak and tugged, pulling him back.

Ulrin ducked just in time to avoid being lobotomized by a cleave of the Crawler’s claw. He tried to turn to face his assailant, but it still had a firm grip on his cloak, and he ended up getting tangled up in it, pinning his sword arm to his side. The creature pulled him in closer, and, left with no other options, Ulrin smashed his lantern into it. The lantern shattered, spreading fire and oil across the creature’s face. It shrieked and released Ulrin to paw at its burning face.

Freed, Ulrin turned, only to find himself facing the Crawler that had cut his leg. His blood still dripped from its claw. It lunged at him, every one of its bony hooks stretched out for an attack. Now more familiar with Silverlight’s capability, Ulrin chose to meet each slash with one of his own. One strike after another, he severed the creature’s limbs off its abominable body. It cried in pain but was quickly silenced forever, but not by Ulrin.

The creatures had little regard for one another when the hunt was on, and another Crawler could not wait for his wounded brethren to get out of its way to get to Ulrin, so it crawled straight over it. Its claws dug into its fellow’s torso and face, killing it, as it took its place assailing Ulrin.

Ulrin took a step back, trying to get the room to properly swing his sword, and his foot slid in the muck. His wounded leg buckled and prevented him from catching his balance. He fell hard to his back, the wind getting knocked from his lungs as he collapsed, followed by the sound of a disturbing crack as the back of his head made contact with the stone.

His vision was filled with a blinding white light, which faded suddenly to be replaced with a swirling black void.

He blinked and gritted his teeth, trying to force his vision to clear. It did, just in time for him to see the shape of the Crawler he had set ablaze. Its hair was still smoldering, its face twisted with rage.

Its claw came down at him, and he could not twist away in time. There was a flash of unbearable pain as the hook dug itself into his shoulder. It went straight through the back and into the bridge, skewering him to it.

He screamed in agony, but it was drowned out by the Crawler’s deafening hiss of victory. It leaned in to finish Ulrin with its fangs.

Ulrin twisted and bent his arm, despite the pain, to angle Silverlight up at it. The blade pierced easily into the creature’s eye, and with a jerk forward, he was able to plunge it deeper into its brain. He twisted his head away from it, praying that his hood would protect his skin from the gushing ichor.

With a roar of effort and pain, Ulrin pushed the creature’s body off him, pulling its claw from the stone and his shoulder. He pushed it in front of himself as he got back to his feet, practically throwing it at the next Crawler in front of him.

The Crawler callously tossed the body out of its way and over the side of the bridge, but Ulrin used that moment to his advantage, diving forward with Silverlight and slicing down in a crescent arc. He removed the creature’s head and used the momentum of the strike to push the body off the path and out of his way.

More scratching behind him. To the sides of him. There were more of them, much more. But he was almost across.

He limped toward the end with all the speed his wounded leg would allow him. Blood seeped out from his wounded shoulder despite his attempts to clutch it with his free hand. The head injury was making him dizzy, and he felt like he was going to vomit, but he forced it down. There would be time for that later if he survived.

With the lantern and its flame gone, he was left in darkness, but he could just barely make out the edge of the bridge and the start of the staircase.

The sounds of his pursuers kept him from hearing the clacking ahead. Nor was he able to see the Blind that had been drawn by the sounds of battle until it was inches in front of him.

He tried to raise his blade, but the dizziness and wounded shoulder slowed him. The Blind grabbed him by both of his arms and held him tightly. Its clawed fingers dug deep into his flesh, sending fresh waves of pain through him. His body reflexively opened its palms. Silverlight fell from his hand, clattered briefly on the stone, and then dropped into the river below.

Behind him, the Crawlers blocked off any retreat.

“So, this is where I die,” Ulrin grunted through the pain. “Just when I thought I was finally getting somewhere. Fate sure is a bitch.”

The creature howled its response and pulled him toward it, its fanged mouth opening wide.

Ulrin tried to pull back and felt the back of his foot go over the edge of the bridge. He had one last idea. If he was going to die, he might as well do it on his terms.

“Hope you bastards can’t swim.”

Ulrin stepped off the edge and put all his weight into falling backward. The Blind tried to hold him up, but it slipped on the black sludge. The two of them went tumbling off the bridge together.

The creature released him as he fell, and for a brief moment, Ulrin was alone in the dark, weightless. He had tried. Nobody could say he hadn’t given it his best. Now, he was finally done.

There was an impact and a flash of cold that chilled him to his veins.

And then nothing.`,

      title: "Chapter 6",
      content: `The bells jingled with every light breeze, every shift in the branch they hung from. Their jingling was the only sound besides the rustling of leaves that broke the night.

Cryaliss watched from her hiding spot, slowly counting under her breath. If any of the Corrupted were nearby, they should be drawn by the sound of the bells. At the very least, any hunting in this area should come to investigate.

Enough time had passed with no sighting of the creatures. It should be safe to move.

She climbed down from the tree she had been hiding in, then made an attempt to brush the dirt off her robes. The crimson robes of the Blood Maidens had long become a muddy brown, but the instinct to keep them clean still took over.

The bells were carefully removed from the branch and wrapped in a soft cloth to keep them from sounding in her pack. She stored them away, then walked back to the clearing where she had left her scavenged supplies.

It was an impressive haul. She had traveled up the Lucent Run and made use of the unexpected daylight to gather in a small farming town that had been left relatively untouched by other scavengers. Her rucksack was filled to the brim and was supplemented by three further satchels. Food, clean water, medicine for fever and infection, soap, and clean clothes. It would make a big difference for the survivor camp.

Perhaps it would not help them in the long run. Perhaps they were only delaying the inevitable. But if she could make a small difference now, it would have been well worth the effort.

And it was an effort, she was reminded as she put on the rucksack and strapped the satchels to her waist. She had never been particularly strong, and the weight of the supplies was at the limit of what she could carry. If not slightly beyond it.

She hauled her burden further into the thicket, up to the rocky hill. The climb here was rough, even empty-handed. With her packs, it was a nightmare. But she would persevere for them. They were counting on her.

One foot after another, she ascended the hill. At one point, she had to drop to her hands and knees and climb, all the while feeling like the weight of her packs would drag her back down. But finally, she came to the opening in the rock, which housed the cave where the survivors were camped.

Her relief at arriving was quickly tempered when she realized that no one seemed to be serving as a lookout. She hoped that they were all just busy inside, in need of a lesson on caution, but unharmed. Or maybe they needed to leave suddenly, and they’d left her some indication of where they were going. But she had a bad feeling.

That feeling was confirmed when she went inside. It was a slaughter. There was no sign of the creature that had done it, but it had been merciless. She counted the bodies just to be sure, in the vain hope that some of them might have escaped. It was difficult, as many of the bodies had been terribly dismembered, but the conclusion she reached was that it indeed represented the entirety of the camp.

She dropped to her knees. It had only been a few days since she had been here. Since this place had been home to twenty survivors, including a family with children. They had been low on food. She was supposed to help them.

But once again, she could do nothing. That seemed to be the only constant in this new world. She was useless.

At least to the living. She could care for the dead.

She set aside her packs for now and began gathering up the bodies and bringing them down the hill, doing her best to keep whole bodies if she could identify which limbs went with which torsos. She used a little water to wet a cloth, washed their faces, and carefully cut their hair with her knife. Then she covered their bodies with leaves and other foliage. To do it properly, she would have needed to dig each an individual grave at least four feet deep. But she had neither the strength nor the tools to do so now. It was the best she could offer.

The last of the Blood Maidens kneeled before the grave and said her prayer:

“Fathers before us, and mothers who birthed us,

Ancestors above us, and dragons below,

Observe now the passing of these noble souls,

These warriors, lovers, dreamers, and doers,

Though cursed with a short mortal life,

They nonetheless persevered to leave their mark,

And we remember their efforts,

This day and the next, till the end of days,

Till our blood stains the same soil.”

It was customary at this point to add a verse to the prayer that was customized to be the people being buried, but she knew next to nothing about them. They had not trusted her, and she did not blame them. Blood Maidens had been met with suspicion and rumor even before The Bleeding. People thought they worshipped dragons and sacrificed children. These things were only partly true.

This group had refused to even tell her their names, so she had nothing to put on a gravestone. She settled on leaving a simple stone marker.

She went back to the cave and retrieved the gathered supplies. They were too heavy for her to carry with her on the off chance she ran into more survivors. Instead, she concealed them at the base of the hill, covering them so they should be safe from the elements and rainfall. With her knife, she carved instructions into the stone on what supplies were hidden and how to find them in case another group of survivors passed through the area. Hopefully, they would get more use out of them than she did.

Taking with her only her own pack and enough to ensure her own survival for a while, she moved on. With no target in mind, she instinctively began to backtrack toward the river.

Since leaving the temple, she had wandered the kingdom, looking for ways to aid those that still lived. Mostly failing. But no matter how far she went or what direction she traveled, she always inevitably returned to this region.

There was no reason why. There was nothing left for her here. Not that there was anything for her anywhere. The only thing that made this place different was the memories.

Here was the thicket where she was taken to hunt wild animals. Blood Maidens needed to be in tune with the blood flowing through all living creatures. She was expected to track game using nothing but this sense. And if she failed to hunt anything, she would be let go hungry. Cryaliss had actually been able to find the game animals easily, as she took to the attunement quickly, but she struggled with actually killing anything. It just felt wrong to end a life.

Eventually, she got hungry enough that she killed a small rabbit. It gave her nightmares for weeks, though her teachers had praised her for being able to sense such a small animal.

She came across the road that led from the western markets into the farmlands and eventually to the river crossing. It had been down this path that her parents had brought her when she was a child. They had too many mouths to feed and not enough money to do it, so they made the decision to sell her to the temple. Cryaliss had not blamed them; she had been happy to be useful in a way that would help her siblings. If anything, she felt a little guilty when she learned just how much the temple had paid for her. She hardly thought of herself being worth nearly that much. She committed herself to her training and education to try to be worthy of the expense.

There was the pond that they had used for their cleansing ceremony. Now, its waters were a murky red, tainted by the Blood Rain, but back then, they had been crystalline. It had been an embarrassing experience for her. She had been stripped in front of the entire temple and then given nothing but a thin cloth to cover herself with as she marched the entire distance from the temple to the pond. The entire way, the Maidens, her teachers, and even the temple administrators were hurling insults at her. About her body, her intelligence, her uselessness. Blood Maidens needed to learn to let such things wash over them, as much of the world treated them with hostility.

She was dipped in the pond, which washed away her old life, misdeeds, mistakes, and the world’s perception of her. Once she was clean, she was given her first set of crimson robes. That was the day she went from apprentice to true Blood Maiden. She remembered the nods of her teachers and the welcoming of her sisters. As uncomfortable as the ritual had been, she still fondly remembered it as one of the best days of her life.

At last, she came to the river. The Lucent Run, named for a myth of a courageous hero who had braved sailing down the river, rapids and all, and survived, in order to warn the cities on the coast of the encroaching dragons. That story of bravery had always made Cryaliss feel cowardly, particularly since she had something of a water phobia. She remembered her first time crossing the bridge known as The Maiden’s Path, how tightly she held the Maiden who had guided her across.

The river was calmer here than it was upstream, nearer the temple, but even here, it was enough to fill her with anxiety. Beneath the fear was a darker thought, though. One that she had been experiencing with increasing frequency each time she looked out at the water. That perhaps she, and the world, would be better off if she tossed herself into the water, never to emerge.

So many dead before her. So many dead because of her. What right did she have to continue to cling to life?

She knew it was wrong to think that way. It was an abandonment of everything she stood for, of everything she had vowed when joining the temple. It was her duty to carry on, no matter how hard it was, how futile.

Cryaliss was the last of the Blood Maidens, and she would not dishonor their memory by conceding her life before her time.

Although that did leave her at an impasse regarding what she should do next. She could make another pass through the Aspya Stretch, looking for survivor camps, but it was increasingly unlikely she would find any. It had been a while since she had last checked the area around the capital. That region had been hardest at the start, and the capital itself had become a living nightmare, but there were many small communities built up around its outskirts that would have shelter and supplies that survivors might use. It would be a considerable trip.

As she was reflecting on her options, a glint of silver nearby caught her attention. One of the blessings of the Blood Maidens was the ability to see in the dark, which certainly came in handy during these extensive nights. Even so, it was unusual for anything to glimmer like that without any light to reflect.

Curiosity drove her closer to the river’s shore than she would normally brave, and there she found the source: a strange sword that seemed to radiate a silver light. Incredibly intricate in its design, she had never seen anything like it.

Next to it, a man’s body had washed ashore. The sword’s owner, perhaps. His cloak was caked in blood, and his skin was pale and wrinkled from the cold water. She wondered whether it was his wounds or the water that had ultimately caused his demise. Guess it didn’t really matter. It seemed she had one more corpse to perform rites on today.

The body shuddered, and she realized that the man was still alive! Despite very much looking like a corpse, it seemed this one’s will to live was causing him to cling on.

She rushed to him and turned him on his back. Holding her hands above his chest, she sensed his blood flowing through him. It was weak, barely a trickle of life still running through him. She grabbed hold of that thread and traced it to the wounds that were still seeping his precious lifeblood. Focusing her attention there, she aided in the blood’s clotting, and within seconds the wounds no longer bled.

It would not be enough. He had lost too much and did not have enough to sustain his heart. Again she traced the flow, finding the route to its origins deep within the man’s bones, within the marrow in his core. She commanded it to produce and release blood at a rate that should have taken the body weeks. There was a crack, and the man shuddered in pain as the bones bent from the pressure. If she was not careful, she would shatter the bones completely, but the man’s case was desperate.

Just enough blood was produced to stabilize his blood flow, and his heart set to work distributing it through his body. Hopefully, it was not too late. Permanent damage could have been done to his organs or brain if they had gone without blood for too long. It would be a while before she could tell.

And the immediate issues were not yet through. The man was shaking from a mix of shock and the freezing water. He needed to be warmed and quickly.

She bent and lifted the stranger using a technique she had learned, putting his arm around her neck and grabbing him under his knees to get him up onto her shoulders. Her back still ached from the heavy packs of supplies earlier, and the man might have been just as heavy, but with care, she was able to get most of the weight onto her knees.

As she was about to leave, some instinct told her she needed to grab one more thing. With a sigh, she bent again, careful not to drop her burden, and was able to get just low enough to grab the odd silver sword. It seemed important and might go a long way to improving the stranger’s mood when he woke up.

If he woke up.

With that sense of urgency instilled in her, she hurried to find a place of safety to care for the stranger.`,

      title: "Chapter 7",
      content: `The sounds of clanging steel rang out through the courtyard as the two duelists came together. Their practice swords, though dull, still had a decent heft to them and gave a satisfying ring when clashing. It was a sound much like music to Ulrin’s ears, a beat more pleasant than anything played in those stuffy balls or recitals he was forced to attend.

Even if he was currently taking a beating.

It was all he could do to parry the Swordmaster’s strikes as they came in rapid succession. He hoped that if he held off long enough and ceded just enough ground, he could create an opening and get a surprise hit off. But Solden’s form was flawless, and despite how fast the attacks came, there wasn’t an inch of a gap created.

“Come on now, young prince,” Solden said lightly, not sounding even the slightest bit winded from the exertion. “You can’t just stay on defense forever. Sword fighting is a lot like courting a woman. If you wait too long to make your move, you’ll miss your chance to thrust.”

Eager to please, and just about out of his stamina to defend, anyway, Ulrin shifted his weight forward for a sudden lunge, aiming to connect with the Swordmaster before he himself was struck. Solden, instead of following through with his strike toward Ulrin’s center, shifted himself mid-stroke for a horizontal cut. He smacked the back of Ulrin’s hand before the sword could reach him, causing Ulrin to drop the practice blade. He then put his own to Ulrin’s throat.

“That was impressive, as always, young prince,” Solden said with a smile. “Your form improves every day.” He lowered his sword to the ground and bowed before the prince.

Ulrin shook his smarting hand. “Sure doesn’t feel like it. Usually, I can score at least one or two points on you. Today I didn’t even get close.”

“Forgive my impertinence. Usually, I adjust my speed and aggressiveness to provide the best possible learning opportunity.”

“You mean you normally hold back,” Ulrin clarified, frowning.

“You could put it that way, yes. But not as an insult. I used stances to test and train very specific aspects of your form that may not receive the attention they deserve in an all-out duel.”

“I guess that makes enough sense.” Ulrin smirked at him. “Guess I don’t need to have my father execute you for the offense.”

“You are most kind, young prince. Though I’m sure his majesty will be saddened by the loss of the opportunity.”

“He’ll get over it.” Ulrin reached down to pick up his practice sword. “So, why’d you feel the need to fully commit this time?”

Solden’s smile faded a little. “A touch of sentimentality, perhaps. Come this time next month, you will be a completely different man. I’m afraid I will no longer be able to beat you in a straight duel.”

“You mean my fifteenth birthday?”

“Indeed. The Drakenblud will make you stronger and faster than any mortal man. Even a well-trained one such as myself.” He picked up his own sword. “Not that I expect you’ll use that as an excuse to give up on your training. I intend to make a proper swordsman out of you, even if I have to be a bit more creative in how I teach you.”

Ulrin couldn’t help but feel a surge of pride at Solden’s praise and respect for him. It sometimes felt like he was trying to live up to his older brother’s impossible standards, and his parents, instructors, and even friends didn’t expect him to succeed. After all, who could possibly be as smart, as tactful, as savvy as Gerevin Emberlind? Only Solden seemed to see the potential in him, not just as his own man, but as a talent worth cultivating.

“You could become Bludded too, can’t you?” Ulrin asked. “I remember hearing father mention it. All Masters in the royal court are entitled to the blessing.”

Solden shook his head. “It is true. I was offered. I think I may be the first and only member of the court to reach the title of Master and turn it down. But for me, it’s a matter of principle. It is important that the art of swordsmanship remains pure. No one can claim that my speed and skill with a sword is anything other than the result of hard work and dedication to the craft.”

“That does sound important.” Ulrin looked thoughtful. “I don’t think I can get out of the ceremony, though.”

Solden laughed. “I wouldn’t want you to if you could, young prince. Your first responsibility is to the kingdom, and the people of Lorn have expectations about their rule. Besides, my rule does not need to be your rule. If you keep to your training, I’d say you are a prime candidate for the Swordmaster title when I retire.”

Ulrin was floored. “You really think so? Even though I’m also a prince? Won’t people think you are playing favorites with the royal family?”

“Oh, I’m sure people will think all kinds of things. Which is why your talent must do the talking. The royal family has long held a multitude of titles, some earned, some inherited. The Swordmaster position will go to the best swordsman. If that is you, then I will be honored for you to add it to your list of titles.”

The prince was practically jumping with excitement. He knew it was undignified of him to show such emotion, and later he would probably be lectured about the proper manner in which he was expected to conduct himself, but he just couldn’t help himself.

He raised his practice sword at the Swordmaster. “Then let’s get back to practicing! One more!”

A familiar woman’s voice cut off his enthusiasm. “Oh no. You are already well past your time, Ulrin.”

His mother, Queen Ceanna, stood at the edge of the training grounds, her arms crossed, a typical look of disappointment on her face.

Solden bowed. “My apologies, Your Grace. We must have lost track of time.” He gave an apologetic smile to Ulrin. “Duty calls, young prince. We shall have to pick this up in your next session.”

Ulrin would rather remain and continue his sword practice, but he knew it would be a losing battle. With a sigh, he handed his sword over to the master and then walked over to his mother with his head low.

She gave a sniff and recoiled in disgust. “Gods, you smell awful. You need to get washed up for supper. Your father is expecting you.”

“Will Gerevin be there?”

She hesitated. “He knows he is expected,” she answered noncommittally.

Ulrin was forced to ignore the unfairness of it all and do as he was told. He went down to the baths, where a group of servants scrubbed him thoroughly and sprayed him with perfumes that left him choking on the lavender scent. Then it was up to his dressing room, where another group had him dressed in multiple layers of fine silk and adorned him with jewelry. He expected that most young men did not have to go through such a hassle just to have dinner with their parents.

Finally, he was deemed presentable and was rushed to the dining hall. His parents were already seated, as were his younger siblings. A handful of visiting nobles were also present to have face time with the king. Ulrin recognized Duke Dallin, who ruled the region close to the border and was the father of his friend, Maxwell. There was also the Master of Students, Jeffries, who was in charge of the University. He didn’t remember the names of the others, so he’d have to try to fake it to not get in trouble.

The guests rose when Ulrin entered to give him the customary bow.

His father was stone-faced as ever. “Glad you can finally join us, Ulrin. Our food has been ready for some time, and our poor guests have been waiting for your arrival to be served.” He sat in his customary spot at the head of the table, dressed in his dinner-host finery.

Ulrin gave an apologetic bow to the table. “My humble apologies. Thank you for your graciousness and patience.”

“Will Prince Gerevin also be joining us?” Duke Dallin inquired, thankfully taking the focus off Ulrin.

Vangress was quick to respond. “I’m afraid Gerevin is working on a matter of great importance for the kingdom, and it will be keeping him late tonight. He sends his regrets and promises to make up for his absence in the near future.”

It was a partial truth. Nobody was really sure what Gerevin was working on in the laboratory beneath the castle. He kept it a secret from everyone, even the king. He promised it was important research for the future and safety of the kingdom. So much trust was placed in him by their parents and the royal court at large that everyone just took his word for it and assumed he would tell them more when it was time. Although their father was growing increasingly frustrated with him missing important functions.

“Quite understandable,” Master Jeffries responded. “It does the heart well to know that the future of the kingdom is in such capable hands. One of the finest students I ever had the pleasure of administering. I look forward to seeing what his research brings us.”

Ulrin took his seat while they were discussing and thought he might have gotten away with not having too much attention drawn to himself when the Master of Students turned his attention to him.

“Prince Ulrin, have you decided on your own focused study subject yet?” Jeffries asked. “I remember when you last toured the campus, you still seemed to be quite uncertain.”

The prince froze. “Ah, well, you see . . .” he struggled out. “I’m still exploring my options, but I hope to have made a decision soon.” That was a safe reply, wasn’t it?

Apparently, not as much as he’d thought. “Oh, dear, that is not good at all, if I may say so, my prince,” Jeffries said. “It is not too much longer until you will be sent to the University to expand your education, as your brother did before you. It is of utmost importance that you pick a specialty before then. The people expect the royal family to be masters of their field.”

Ulrin did not know the polite response.

Fortunately, Duke Dallin came to his rescue. “I believe the prince’s priorities are quite straight. Don’t forget, his fifteenth birthday is next month, and with that comes the Drakenblud Ceremony. His focus should be entirely on preparing himself physically and mentally for that power and responsibility and not on courses that are still a year away. Wouldn’t you agree?”

Master Jeffries reluctantly agreed, and Ulrin made a note to send some form of thanks to the duke through his son.

Vangress folded his hands in front of him. “I am certain Prince Ulrin will have made his decision before the time comes.” His tone made it sound more like an order than an assurance.

Ulrin was saved from any further awkwardness by the arrival of the meal. The servants always put on a big presentation serving the food when they had guests, and it drew everyone’s attention for a time. During the meal itself, the real business was discussed, as it was custom to wait till the king had wine in hand and food in his belly to make asks of him. There was discussion of taxes, trade agreements, and leeway for conscription quotas, all well above Ulrin’s head. He was glad Gerevin was the heir to the throne; he was not sure he would be able to handle it.

Ulrin spent the rest of the dinner imitating his younger siblings, being quiet and mostly focused on properly and neatly eating his meal. Once the food was done, he excused himself as soon as it would be polite to do so. His father gave him a look that suggested he was less than pleased but allowed his son to go.

What he wanted to do was go straight down to the floors beneath the castle and see his brother. Gerevin rarely left the lab these days, and Ulrin grew concerned, despite assurances from his parents that his brother was capable of managing himself. They used to be so close, but Gerevin had not been the same since returning from the University.

But before he could get down there, he was interrupted by another obligation. At least, this was a welcome one.

“I hope you haven’t forgotten we were going to study tonight, little Ully.” His grandmother, Omma, waited for him just outside the dining hall.

“Of course not, Omma. I was just on my way to you,” he lied.

She was too wise to fall for it, as her smile plainly told. “Oh, I know. Well, since you were on your way, how about we walk to my room together?”

Caught in her trap, Ulrin followed his grandmother up to her chamber at the top level of the castle. Despite her age, she showed no sign of being slowed by the multiple sets of spiral staircases she had to climb. Ulrin, on the other hand, was still exhausted from his sword training and was huffing by the time they reached the top.

“Oh, dear, you seem quite winded,” Omma said as they entered her room. “Are they not feeding you well enough? You’re a growing boy. You need to eat a lot to keep your energy up.”

“I’m fine, grandmother. I just came from dinner.”

“Hmmm, well, perhaps a snack, at least.”

“No, really, I couldn’t . . .”

“It’s no trouble. It will be just a moment.”

There was no arguing with Omma, so Ulrin simply waited while she did as she pleased. Omma didn’t like servants waiting on her, so she had claimed a set of rooms that included its own kitchen so she could prepare small meals and refreshments for herself. She returned a short while later with a platter of cookies and a cup of tea.

“Now then, you get your energy back, and I’ll get the books,” she said.

“Reading about history is just going to make me tired again,” Ulrin argued.

“Oh, come, now, my lessons aren’t that bad. Besides, it’s either this, or you can learn under one of the tutors your mother has chosen.”

He grimaced at the thought. “What I meant to say is, thank you for taking the time to tutor me, grandmother.”

What followed was a dull, though not unpleasant, hour of learning about Lorn’s history around the time of the Reformation. Ulrin enjoyed spending time with Omma. She was kind, funny, and incredibly sharp. Most of the time, anyway.

She had her spells, though. One of which she experienced as their lesson was coming to an end. He turned to her to ask for clarification on a page about the Lost King and saw her sitting there, expression confused, eyes lost.

It was during these times, when she didn’t know where she was or what she was doing, that her age really showed. The wrinkles on her face, the fraying of her gray hair, the looseness of her skin. She appeared so powerful most of the time; it was painful to see her seeming so frail and helpless.

Fortunately, this was a short one, and she quickly came back to herself, acting, as she always did, as if nothing had happened and there was nothing to worry about.

“Well, I think that will do for today, Ully,” Omma said, closing the book. “It’s not good to try to cram too much in one day. You’ll never retain it.”

“Grandmother . . .”

“No, no. That is quite enough. We shall pick up from here next week.” She gave him a wan smile. “Now, I’m afraid these old bones need a rest. Be a good boy and clean up the platter before you go.”

He did as he was told, feeling guilty that he could not help her more. And even more guilty that he was relieved to be free. Now he could do what he had set out to do earlier.

It was getting late, so many of the castle’s residents had already retired to their rooms, and a minimum of servants were still about their duties. But he knew he would find his brother down in the laboratory despite the hour.

Down he went to the central floor, then further down in the lower levels, and further still to the passages that ran through the rock beneath the castle itself. These tunnels led to the most secure parts of the castle, including the treasury, the Chamber of Ascension, and, of course, the laboratories. Guards were posted at important entryways to keep unauthorized visitors from snooping about. They saluted Ulrin as he passed while keeping their eyes ahead.

Gerevin’s lab was sealed tight, as usual. Ulrin knocked at the main entrance, to no response. Frustrated, he continued knocking, increasingly louder, until he was practically pounding on it.

Finally, the door opened partway, just enough for him to see his brother through it. Gerevin looked different these days. He was skinnier, leaner, and more disheveled. He had bags under his eyes, and his long, white-blond hair was dirty. It was likely he was not eating, sleeping, and grooming enough. After all, he was hardly seen out of the lab. Even his skin was growing paler from the lack of sun.

“Hi, Ulrin,” he said softly. “I’m sorry. I don’t really have time for a visit. I’m in the middle of a vital part of my research.”

“That’s what you said the last three times I’ve come to see you. It can’t always be a vital part.”

“It can.”

Ulrin squinted, trying to get a look at the lab, but Gerevin blocked the way. “I’m worried about you, Gerevin. I hardly ever see you anymore.”

Gerevin feigned a smile. “You needn’t worry about me. I know how to take care of myself. And I promise to spend some time with you as soon as my work is complete. In the meantime, you should really focus on your own improvement. Have you been doing well in your sword lessons with Master Solden?”

A strange thing to inquire about, Ulrin thought. But he wouldn’t miss the opportunity to brag. “Yeah. He even said that I’m a candidate to be the next Swordmaster!”

His brother nodded, though he didn’t seem to share Ulrin’s excitement. “That’s good. Continue to work at it. And it may be best if you started carrying a sword around with you. I’m sure father would approve a ceremonial sheath as part of your outfit.”

“Carrying a sword? Why would I need to—”

He was cut off by something heavy rattling and falling over behind Gerevin. The elder prince quickly glanced behind him, then back to Ulrin. “Sorry, Ulrin. We’ll talk more later. I promise.”

And then the door was slammed shut and sealed once more.

Ulrin spent some time standing out there, his hand on the door. He was surrounded at all times by servants, guards, and nobility, and yet he often felt lonely. Gerevin was the one person who used to dispel that feeling.

Now, he was just alone.`,

      title: "Chapter 8",
      content: `The dream faded away, and as the waking world returned to Ulrin, so did all his aches and pains. Given how terrible he felt, he must have taken a real beating this time. Ah, well, at least he was warm. Weirdly warm.

What was this unusual warmth touching him?

He opened his eyes and was met with an unfamiliar woman whose nude body was pressed up against his. His face flushed, making him warmer than he already was. How’d he wind up in this situation?

Her hazel eyes met his. “Oh, thank goodness. You’re awake. I was beginning to worry that you wouldn’t.”

“Who are— Where am— Why are we—” Ulrin struggled to pick which question he needed answered first.

She inched away from him. “I’m sorry. You were nearly dead when I found you. Your body needed warmth, and the small fire I started did not seem to be enough. I dared not make the fire larger, for risk of drawing unwanted attention. So, I used my body heat to warm yours.”

His memories of his last moments before losing consciousness came back to him. The fight on the bridge. The certainty of death. Falling into the river. The peace that came with finally meeting his end.

Seemed that he had somehow survived yet again. For all the good and bad that came with it.

“Then I owe you my thanks,” Ulrin said. “And my life. I promise to repay this debt however I am able.”

“There’s no need for that. I was simply doing my duty to help someone in need.”

She rose, and Ulrin averted his eyes from her body. He heard the rustling of clothes, and when he looked back at her, she was dressed in well-worn robes. Though the color had faded and become obscured by dirt, there was no mistaking that crimson.

“You’re a Blood Maiden,” he surmised.

She looked down at her feet. “Yes. I am Maiden Cryaliss. I am sorry if that bothers you.”

“No, it doesn’t bother me. If anything, it might be providence. I was on my way to your temple when I was, well . . .” He gestured to his injuries. “When this happened to me.”

Her eyes went wide. “Why would you want to go to the temple?”

“Looking for answers.”

Cryaliss shook her head. “I don’t think you will find any. There’s nothing left there but death.”

Ulrin tried to rise, clutching the thick blanket that was the only thing covering his nudity, but a sharp pain in his chest made him stop. He must have cracked a rib during his fall. It didn’t feel too serious, but he would have to be careful until he had recovered.

“Well, that raises even more questions,” he said, settling back down. “And I’d love to ask them. But first, uh, you think I could get my clothes?”

“They are drying near the fire over there. There was quite a bit of blood covering them, some of it yours, some of it the ichor of the Corrupted, so I washed them as best I could. I was also going to offer to sew up the nasty tears in your cloak and overcoat. I always travel with my needle for just such an occasion.” She held up a hem of her robe to show a section that had been patched.

Once more, he tried to rise, this time more gently and carefully, and was able to get into a seated position. “If you are so inclined, I’d appreciate it. Not wise to run about with big holes in your clothes, exposing your skin. I must have gotten pretty lucky that none of that ichor got me. I do hope you took care while washing and caring for me. I’d hate if your generosity caused you to make direct contact with the vile stuff.”

“You needn’t worry. My conditioning as a Blood Maiden has made me immune to the Corruption.”

That revelation nearly made Ulrin jump, but the pain in his chest stopped him. “You’re serious? The rain, the ichor, it has no effect on you?”

Cryaliss put a hand to her throat in a strange gesture akin to choking herself. “The conditioning to handle raw Drakenblud, purify it for use, changes our bodies. It makes us sick, in a way. Deteriorates us over time. Maidens don’t often live to see their fortieth birthday. It also prevents us from becoming Bludded ourselves. I was told that since our bodies cannot handle the Drakenblud, they reject it, expel it. And, as it turned out, they also protected us when the Blud became corrupted. If I’m in the crimson rain for too long, I get nauseous for a while, but after my body has finished expelling everything, I am fine.”

“I heard there was dark magic involved with the Blood Maidens. I had no idea it shortened your lives like that. Hardly seems fair, given that those granted the Drakenblud you purify were given extended lifespans. I’m sorry.”

She shook her head. “There’s no need for you to be apologizing. It’s not like you had anything to do with the process.”

No, but my family did, Ulrin thought. The Emberlind dynasty had long had demands for refined Drakenblud for the royal family and the Masters who served them. He wondered how many people knew about the cost of making it. Did his father sanction making young women sick and letting them die young in the name of carrying on the legacy of Bludded rulers? He must have.

Cryaliss must have misread the guilt on his face as worry, for she rushed to reassure him. “Oh, but I’m not physically weaker or anything. Not at my age, anyway. That part won’t come till later. And it comes with certain advantages. I can use my control over blood to treat certain wounds, for example. Like I did with the lacerations on your shoulder and leg.”

Ulrin sighed. “The more we talk, the deeper my debt to you seems to get.”

“No, no! Like I said, I was simply doing my duty. We, Maidens, are first and foremost servants of the people.”

Ulrin looked over the Blood Maiden in front of him, this kind and demure young woman who had saved his life. She was quite different from the stories about the Maidens he had heard. They had a reputation as witches, cruel and manipulative. The king had called them a “necessary evil,” as only they could refine the Drakenblud. It had given Ulrin this image of old crones with crooked noses and yellowed teeth casting spells from the darkness of their temple.

Not only did Cryaliss act very differently, but she also looked so . . . normal. Her features were fairly plain, not unattractive, per se, but not really good-looking, either. Dark hair framed her face and fell to her shoulders. If it wasn’t for the crimson robes, she would not have stood out in a crowd.

“How many more of you are there?” he asked. If they were truly immune to the Corruption, and they were unlikely to turn him into a frog, then they could make powerful allies.

Her gaze again found the ground. “I’m the only one left.”

Ulrin’s slightly boosted spirits sank back down. “You said there was nothing left at the temple but death. What exactly happened?”

She wouldn’t look at him. “There was . . . an attack. The temple should have been safe, but . . .” She shook her head. “I was the only one who escaped. The temple belongs to the Corrupted now.”

“That might explain why there were so many of them on the bridge,” Ulrin pondered, rubbing his chin.

“Yes. And there are more on the islet and inside the temple. I recommend choosing a different course.”

He noticed she was still avoiding his gaze, as if afraid of giving something away if she looked him in the eye. Clearly hiding something. But she hadn’t given him any reason to think she was untrustworthy. He decided not to press it for now.

“I’ll take your word for it. Though I don’t really have another course. I’d show you my journal, but even if my pack managed to survive my fall, I’m sure everything inside got waterlogged. The temple was my last hope for answers.”

“What kind of answers?”

“Tricks or tools to kill the Corrupted. Particularly the nasty ones, the ones who were Bludded before The Bleeding.” Such as his father. “How the Drakenblud and the Corruption works. If I was really feeling hopeful, maybe even find ways to prevent or stop it from continuing to happen. Though I wasn’t really holding my breath.”

She pulled at the edges of her robe. “I’m sorry. I must be a disappointment not to have these answers. The Matrons, the leaders of our order, might have. There were many secrets that only they were entitled to learn. When The Bleeding happened, they started locking themselves away for long hours, working on something in secret. My sisters and I thought they might have understood what was happening and how to stop it. But they wouldn’t share any details about what they knew or what they were working on. We just had to trust them.”

Sounds familiar, Ulrin thought, thinking of his brother’s time in the lab. “Did anything come of their work?”

“I don’t know for sure. I’ve always assumed they were not yet finished when . . .” She grimaced. “When the temple fell. Whatever knowledge they had died with them.”

“Probably. Though that’s still a better lead than I’ve had in a long time.” He broke into a coughing fit before he could continue. His throat was incredibly sore. Strange he hadn’t noticed it until now. Must have been distracted.

Cryaliss rushed over to him with a flask of water. “Here, drink. Your body is going to need plenty of fluids to recover what was spent in your healing.”

He took the flask gratefully, and it wasn’t until he had drained half of it that he stopped himself. “Sorry, I should be more careful. I know clean water is tough to find.”

“No, it’s okay. I know where more is hidden if I need it. Besides, I feel responsible for you. I used my ability to treat you without your permission, and now you’re suffering the side effects.”

“Just for future reference, anytime you find me half-dead, you have my permission to use your ability to try to save my life.”

She smiled. It was the first genuine smile he had seen in a long time. “I’ll remember that. I’m sorry. I don’t think I’ve gotten your name yet.”

“Maxwell.” He lied about his name on instinct, though it felt wrong to lie to someone who seemed so open and genuine. What were the odds she blamed the royal family for The Bleeding, like so many others did? He was still weak and couldn’t take any chances.

“Maxwell?” She looked at him curiously.

“Something the matter?”

“I just thought . . . No, never mind. It’s nice to make your acquaintance, Maxwell.”

She seemed suspicious. Could she have recognized him? He didn’t have access to a mirror right now, but he would bet all the dirt in his hair had gotten washed away in the river. She’d also gotten a close look at his eyes. If she recognized the signs of the royal family, she might have already identified him. In which case, he just seemed like an untrustworthy liar.

But she didn’t push him on it. Instead, she went to retrieve her sewing needle and Ulrin’s clothes and patch up the holes from his most recent battle. Maybe it had been a figment of his imagination.

“How far downriver did I wind up?” Ulrin asked after a period of silence.

“About a mile or so from the temple, I think. Not too far out from the hills bordering the Stretch.”

“Not too far a walk, then. Good. Once my clothes are ready and I’ve had a bit of a chance to recover, I can make another attempt at the bridge.”

She lowered her needle and looked at him like he had just sprouted horns from his head. “Do you seek death? I already told you there is nobody alive there besides the Corrupted. You already nearly died once just on the approach. Who do you hope to find?”

“Some of the work the Matrons did might remain. It might be the only place in the world where answers about the Corrupted might be found. I can’t just walk away from it.” Though he tried to sound confident, the thought of returning to the bridge filled him with dread.

“And if you face the same enemies once again? I was barely able to keep you alive this time. Next time . . .”

Ulrin knew all too well. “Now that I’m more aware of what I’m facing, I can try to be better prepared for it. Although, I’ll admit that without Silverlight, my odds have likely dropped dramatically.”

“Silverlight?”

“My sword.” He winced at the memory of dropping it from the bridge. “A powerful artifact I had just recovered. I was just beginning to think my odds were improving, thanks to it. So, of course, I lost it right away. Fell into the river right before I did. Probably sank to the bottom or washed out to sea.”

“Oh? I thought it looked unique.” She gestured to the other side of the fire, near where she had a pile of supplies. There, leaning up against the bark of a fallen tree, was Silverlight. “It washed up just beside you. Never seen anything like it. Figured you’d miss it if you woke without it.”

He was stunned. What were the odds that he and the sword would be washed up in the same place? Certainly not an impossibility, but given their difference in weight, and the time between when they fell, it was truly extraordinary.

Cryaliss took his speechlessness as a sign of agitation. “I’m sorry for putting it out of reach. I couldn’t be sure, if you woke up, what sort of mental state you would be in. There are far too many quickly prone to violence.”

“No, that’s quite alright. Thank you for bringing it. I thought for sure it was lost.” A glimmer of hope, fleeting as it was, was relit within him. “I may actually have a chance now.”

She looked over at the sword, which reflected the firelight across the silver stream that ran down it. “There are stories that tell of legendary weapons whose destinies were tied to those of their chosen bearers. When joined, they would become greater than the sum of their parts. Even if separated, they would be reunited by providence, as if the weapon itself knew to seek its wielder. Maybe you have a similar bond with this sword.”

Ulrin scratched at his chin. “I’m not too sure about that. I only had the sword for a short time before nearly losing it and my life in the process. But it’s nice to be given a second chance all the same. I won’t waste it.”

Cryaliss nodded, then returned to her needlework. “I take it you won’t be dissuaded from trying to reach the temple, particularly now that your weapon has been returned. I suppose the only proper thing for me to do in this situation, short of tying you up and trying to drag you elsewhere, is to accompany you.”

“What? No! It is far too dangerous.”

“Oh? But not too dangerous for you?”

“I’m choosing to take the risk.”

“And so am I.” She finished her work on the cloak’s tear and held it up to examine her patchwork. “I won’t hold you back. I know things about the temple that could be helpful. Entrances that will allow you to avoid the main hall, where the bulk of the Corrupted is likely still gathered. The way up to the Matrons’ quarters. Where the keys are kept.”

“A guide to the temple would be helpful,” Ulrin admitted. “Assuming we survive the bridge, anyway. But why would you want to? You said yourself that you see trying to reach the temple as tantamount to suicide.”

“I’m just looking to do some good. If I can help you find your answers, it will have been worth the risk. Besides, if you truly do have some great destiny with that fancy sword of yours, I would want to see it.”

She argued, but her voice was sad, resigned. Though he barely knew her, Ulrin’s heart broke for this young woman. He owed her too much to let her die, but he also had no good reason to refuse her help. Sure, it was dangerous, but so was just surviving in this world.

Beneath his sympathy, there was a lingering doubt about his new companion’s trustworthiness. Not just because she was a Blood Maiden, whom he had been brought up to distrust, but she seemed very quick to offer aid and volunteer for what was likely to be a deadly excursion. Survivors these days rarely offered anything up for free. But whatever it was she hoped to gain from Ulrin, he couldn’t see it.

Maybe she truly was just a kind person who wanted to help him. The last of the decent folk. He’d have to be on his guard, nonetheless.

“Fine,” Ulrin conceded. “But you stay well behind me. Don’t move until I’ve cleared a path, and if it looks like I’m going to be overrun, you retreat. I won’t have you die for me.”

“I’ll agree to your conditions, but only if you agree to mine.” She gestured to his wounded shoulder with her needle. “You wait until you are recovered before you begin this little crusade. If you try to cross the bridge in this state, I will stand between you and the creatures.”

He would have argued about wasting time, but as he shifted his body, he was reminded of just how bad his aches were. “You drive a hard bargain. Very well. We’ll need to be careful if we intend to camp out for a while, as this area is not safe.”

“I’ll take care of it. You just rest for now.”

His energy drained, and with it, his will to argue, so he lay back down. Though he still had some misgivings, he felt he could trust Cryaliss would not allow anything to happen to him while he rested. As he waited to be taken by an uncomfortable sleep, he repeated his encounter on the bridge in his head, plotting what he could do differently on his next attempt.

As it would turn out, he needn’t have bothered.`,

      title: "Chapter 9",
      content: `Ulrin recovered from his injuries faster than he expected. A lingering effect of the power the Blood Maiden had used to save his life, he was told. His body was working at an unnatural speed to repair his wounds and get him back to peak condition.

The consequences of this rapid healing were nearly as bad as the wounds themselves. He faced sudden body temperature swings, bouts of extreme thirst, piercing headaches, and exhaustion that saw him sleeping the days away. Cryaliss cared for him at every turn, but his concern was less about his condition and more about the creatures of the Aspya Stretch. If they found him in this state, he would be unable to fight them, and he worried that Cryaliss would not do the sensible and flee for her own life.

Fortunately, the time passed without incident, and Ulrin’s strength returned. During his last few days of convalescence, he took to practicing his sword stances with Silverlight. The sword had lived up to its reputation as a weapon, slicing through the rough hides of the Corrupted with all the ease of cutting air. But while that was clearly ideal, it did leave him in a bit of an awkward spot when it came to his follow-through. Typically, he would expect some resistance when striking something, and the instinct to follow through to drive his blade deeper was ingrained. When fighting with Silverlight, this instinct would cause him to accidentally overextend, even stumble forward, as the blade didn’t slow in the slightest as it cleaved through his enemies.

He tried to imagine what Master Solden would say about it. After chastising him about his reliance on a weapon that did all the work instead of focusing on his pure talent, he would tell Ulrin that there was no reason for a Swordmaster to ever have his blade out of place or his feet out of position. “Control the blade, or the blade will control you.”

Following the imagined advice, he practiced adjusted versions of his sword forms that would allow him to take advantage of the lower amount of striking force required to cut with Silverlight, as well as allow him to get the blade back into position faster after the strike. He wouldn’t know its effectiveness for sure until he put it to the test.

While he was making progress in his health and his swordsmanship, he felt he was getting nowhere in understanding the Blood Maiden who had saved him. Their conversations remained surface level when they could manage to talk at all. Whenever he tried to ask her more details about the temple or the life of the Blood Maidens, she would only repeat what she had already said or suddenly get very quiet. She didn’t seem to have much of a life outside the temple, either, so there wasn’t much to talk about there.

And Ulrin wasn’t helping matters. Since he had decided to hide his identity, whenever he was asked about himself, he could only give vague responses in the role of Maxwell. He had considered whether he should just come clean, but he was worried that revealing himself as a liar would break what little trust they had in each other.

So, although he had now spent more time with Cryaliss than any other living person in years, he still knew very little about her. He’d have to trust his initial impressions.

---

It finally came time for the excursion to the temple. It was daylight, for a change, though thick black clouds blocked most of the sunshine. It was just bright enough that Ulrin could see without the use of a lantern, but not enough to impede the Corrupted. It was likely the best they would get for a long while.

As they gathered up what remained of their supplies, Ulrin again offered Cryaliss the chance to back down from this mission.

“I cannot guarantee your safety when there are that many Corrupted about,” he reminded her. “There’s a chance neither of us will make it past the bridge.”

“I know. I’m not afraid.”

If she was a liar, she was a good one.

With enough supplies packed to last them a few days, the two began their journey back up the Lucent Run toward the temple.

They were within a stone’s throw of the bridge when they spotted the first body. The Blind, by the looks of it, though with its head pulverized, it was hard to tell.

The corpses of further Corrupted littered the ground before the bridge and along the bank of the river. As the top of the bridge came into view, they saw that it, too, was covered in severed claws, twisted limbs, and split torsos. Some Ulrin could identify as belonging to Crawlers. Others matched mutations experienced by Dancers or Liars. And then there were some that looked like nothing Ulrin had yet seen, terrifying hooks the size of Ulrin’s body and fleshy spikes that reminded him of thorn bushes. Whatever they had been, they had been brutalized the same way.

“What happened here?” Cryaliss whispered. She looked to Ulrin. “Did you—”

“I wish I could take credit. I only managed to kill a few before I took my unfortunate dip. And this is a far larger horde than I had seen. Had I tried to cross against these odds, well, I would definitely be dead.”

“Then what could have . . .” She held a hand to her chest. “We shouldn’t do this. If whatever killed those creatures finds us, we will stand no chance.”

“No reason to come all this way and turn around, especially not when the path has been so kindly cleared for us. Besides, we don’t know if it’s even still here. It could be anywhere right now.” Besides, he thought, there’s nowhere else for me to go. He just hoped that, whatever it was, Silverlight was up to the challenge.

Ignoring Cryaliss’s further objections, Ulrin made his way up the stairs and onto the bridge. She hesitated, but eventually followed suit.

Even cleared of creatures, The Maiden’s Path was still treacherous, and the addition of corpses and limbs strewn about added a layer of complexity to the careful movements needed to cross the sludge. He’d have to be careful when moving the bodies out of the way to keep their ichor from getting on him. Thanks to Cryaliss, his cloak and gambeson had been patched and should offer him a degree of protection, but if he got some on his gloves and accidentally touched his face, that was the end.

“It’s terrible,” Cryaliss whispered behind him. “They’ve been mutilated. Even the Corrupted deserve better.”

“Respectfully, I disagree,” he responded, gently kicking a severed leg out of his path and off the bridge. “As far as I’m concerned, I’d shed no tears if every last Corrupted in Lorn suffered the same fate.”

“They were human once. Remember that. Would you think the same if these creatures were your former friends, family, or loved ones?”

Her tone was so somber that it gave Ulrin pause and made him question his stance for a moment.

But only for a moment. “Once they turn, they’re no longer that person. They’re just a monster that needs to be destroyed.” He did not add that the whole point of everything he was doing was killing the creature that had been his father.

Thinking about his father made him question if this slaughter could have been done by one of the Bludded. They had become creatures far greater and more terrifying than any of the other Corrupted. Something like Vangress could have easily done this.

Yet, Ulrin had never seen a case of two Corrupted fighting each other. Sometimes, in the heat of the hunt, they would slay each other to be the first to their prey in a mad frenzy of claws and fangs, but even if they were chasing someone across the bridge, it couldn’t explain this carnage.

Could it be an ally? Perhaps someone who had learned the secrets left by the Matrons and turned them into a way to devastate the Corrupted? He knew not to get his hopes up, but it was better than imagining the alternative.

“We can still turn back,” Cryaliss whimpered. “It’s not too late.”

“You can turn back if you want.”

She followed him as they reached the other end of the bridge and descended the stairs onto the islet.

Ulrin got his first look at the islet and the Temple of the Blood Maidens. The temple covered most of the land here, leaving only a trail of stones from the bridge to the entrance and a shelf of jagged rocks between it and the coursing river. It was a squat, two-story structure full of bizarre, triangular geometry. Triangular landing above the doorway, triangular windows along the second floor, and triangular roof gables that competed for height with triangular spires. An old stone foundation was overlaid with wood, dyed crimson red, and then corroded by the river spray, only to be patched with more of the same. It somehow seemed simultaneously dilapidated and imposing.

The front entrance was open, and the corpses of even more creatures lined the entryway. A trail of ichor ran into the temple beyond. Whatever had committed this slaughter, it had passed through here.

Cryaliss grabbed Ulrin’s arm as he was about to go in. She was shaking. “It’s in there. I can sense it. It’s different. Powerful, intense, like the crimson rain given a single body. The Corruption courses through it, yet there’s something else. Another presence I can’t make sense of within it. And there’s this . . . smell to its blood. Like flame and sulfur.”

“How far inside?”

“The main hall. It is just . . . lingering there. We need to hide. Wait for whatever this is to pass. When it leaves, we can search the temple.”

Logically speaking, he knew Cryaliss was likely right. But Ulrin was not thinking with logic at the moment. Hearing “flame and sulfur” made him think of his father, the charred corpses of his younger siblings, and his castle aflame. That stretch was permanently ingrained in his mind. Had Vangress left the ruins of the royal castle and taken to hunting his former subjects as Corrupted? Or was there something else besides him that possessed that power?

Either way, he was itching for a confrontation with it. Now was his chance.

He pulled his arm free from Cryaliss. “You wait here.”

Without waiting for a response, he stepped through the threshold into the temple, drawing Silverlight as he went. He had to trust that this sword lived up to its legends when it mattered the most.

The temple’s main hall reminded Ulrin of the dining hall in the royal castle. It was an oval room with a vaulted ceiling dominated by a long table in the center. Arched passageways beyond the table led deeper into the temple. Along the wall between these arches was elaborately calligraphed writing in a language that Ulrin couldn’t read but recognized from his studies: Draconic.

But all of that was an afterthought for Ulrin as his attention was drawn to the man seated at the end of the table. He brushed his long, white-blond hair out of his red eyes as he turned the page on the text he had opened in front of him. Several candles were lit in front of him, and their flickering light cast an eerie reflection upon his pallid face. He had become thinner, paler, his eyes had grown narrower, and his lips thinner, but there was still no question of this man’s identity.

“Gerevin!”

Ulrin’s older brother, the eldest son of King Vangress and the heir to the throne of Lorn, looked up from the text and met his eyes. “Ulrin.”

Ulrin was so overwhelmed with emotions and questions that he struggled to form a coherent thought, and he spoke in a jumbled mess. “How are you— I thought you were— You were Bludded, you should be— How long have you been— Where have you been?”

Gerevin’s eyes were cold. “I do not know why you are grinning so. If you are expecting a warm-hearted family reunion, you will find none here. I will not tolerate you interrupting my research with your inane chatter.”

“What? Chatter?” Ulrin realized that he had been smiling, beaming really, at the joy of his brother alive, unmutated, and seemingly in control of his own mind, but the smile faded quickly at Gerevin’s tone. “How can you say that? It’s been five years, Gerevin! Are you not happy to see me?”

His brother was expressionless. “Would it matter if I was? If I rushed to embrace you with familial affection, would it end the blight of Corruption? Would Lorn be restored, the people returned, and the world set to rights? Or would it accomplish nothing but a fleeting moment of familiarity?”

Ulrin could not believe what he was hearing. “You can’t possibly mean that. After losing our family, our home, everything, living in this twisted shadow of what was once our kingdom for five grueling years . . . you don’t care to see me, to see that I’m alive, that we found each other?”

“Perhaps if I thought you had some use. Some talent to exploit. But as I remember, your skill set was quite limited, and I doubt you’ve committed yourself to studying since. Right now, you’re little more than a nuisance, distracting me from work.” Gerevin turned his attention back to the text and away from his dumbfounded brother.

As Ulrin stood there, reeling from the whiplash of emotional extremes, a hand on the back of his shoulder caused him to start.

Cryaliss’s hand trembled, and she gripped him for support. “Be careful. That is who I was sensing. He may look normal, but all that power, the Corruption, is coming from him. He’s what slaughtered all those creatures outside. I’m sure of it.”

Ulrin tightened his grip on Silverlight. “Is this true, Gerevin? Are you Corrupted?”

His brother did not bother to look up at him. “I do not understand your surprise. All of the Blud has been turned by the Corruption, and all the Bludded turned with it. I am no exception.”

“But you look normal!” Ulrin argued as his desperation to deny the truth rose. “And you clearly still have your mind! How else would you be able to understand me?”

“You think the Corrupted lack understanding, Ulrin?” Gerevin shook his head and closed the text. “No, it is you who does not understand. Who they are, who they were, remains. Their memories, their hopes and dreams, their knowledge of language, all of it. It is merely buried, deprioritized in favor of stronger emotions and desires. The need to hunt. To kill. To satisfy a primal rage. They understand every word spoken to them, every plea for mercy, every cry for help. And they choose to ignore it in favor of fulfilling their true nature. It’s admirable, in a way, their single-minded dedication. Even if they lack the willpower to keep themselves from becoming beasts.”

Ulrin did not know how to respond. Should he be happy that his brother still had his senses? Should he be terrified because he was facing a powerful Corrupted capable of logical thought and tactics? Was it really still Gerevin, or just a monster that had his face?

Cryaliss, despite her obvious terror, dared to step beside Ulrin to confront the Corrupted prince. “Are you trying to claim you have been able to hold on to your humanity simply because you have more willpower?”

Gerevin held his hands out in front of him, a gesture that indicated that it should be obvious. “I am their better. That was true before The Bleeding and has only become more apparent since.”

She pointed a finger at him, then traced that finger in a triangular pattern through the air as her eyes narrowed in concentration. “No,” she said as she recoiled, as if her finger had been burned. “No, you’re lying. There’s something else that sets you apart. I can sense it.”

“Oh?” Gerevin leaned forward over the table. “You’re a true Blood Maiden. Here I took you for some opportunistic scavenger who lucked across that distinctive robe and used it to fool my far too trusting brother. It is interesting that any of you remain. Was this but a few years prior, you might have had some use to me. Unfortunately, I think that time has passed. You’re now little more than a relic of a different world.”

Ulrin had heard enough. Whatever this creature was, it clearly was no longer his brother. Gerevin would never act like this.

But fighting it was also not likely a good idea. Clearly, Gerevin had grown incredibly powerful. Even a Bludded shouldn’t have been able to tear apart Corrupted like that, and Gerevin didn’t even look wounded or tired from the effort. It would be best if they could get out of there without a confrontation.

“Fine, it’s clear you have no desire for a reunion,” Ulrin said. “I’ll let you get back to your work. My associate and I will be going upstairs.”

Gerevin rose from his seat. “Upstairs? Why, Ulrin, you wouldn’t be heading to the chambers of the Matrons, would you? Don’t tell me you came all this way looking for this?”

He picked up the text from the table and held it up for Ulrin to see. It was a simple leather-bound tome with triangular patterns stitched into the cover using crimson thread.

“The Crimson Journal,” Cryaliss said. “That was meant for the eyes of the Matrons only. You shouldn’t have that!”

Gerevin shrugged. “If they had an objection to my reading from it, they have been quiet on the matter. In fact, the whole temple has been welcomingly silent since my arrival.”

“Does that journal have what we are looking for?” Ulrin asked.

Cryaliss’s eyes went wide in realization. “It contains the secrets of the Drakenblud, added to and passed down by each generation of Matrons. If their research led to any answers, they would have recorded it in there!”

“So, I was right,” Gerevin replied. “You came seeking the secrets of the Blud. I doubt just for your education. You’ve never been one to seek knowledge just for knowledge’s sake. No, you are hoping to find some secret you can use to fight the Corrupted.”

Ulrin couldn’t help but bristle at his brother’s tone. “Is that so wrong? To want to fight back against the shit state the kingdom is in? I’d think you, of all people, would understand.”

“Ah, yes, the duty of the royal family. I remember it well. The pressure. The anxiety. The expectation that your entire life would be dedicated to the good of the kingdom. I do not miss it. I am beyond such trivial obligations now.”

Only caution kept Ulrin from rushing toward this imposter to stab it with Silverlight. How dare it speak such irreverence while wearing Gerevin’s face?

But he knew if he did that, he would die. This creature showed no concern for his former brother and likely wouldn’t hesitate to tear him apart like the Corrupted outside.

Gerevin turned the journal over in his hand. “Tell me, brother, if you did find what you were looking for, what would you do with it? What is your goal?”

Ulrin squeezed the hilt of his sword. “I will return to the castle, and I will slay the creature that was once our father.”

His former brother tilted his head curiously. “Unfortunate. If your goal was slightly more realistic, I might have been tempted to give this to you. But if you intend to waste your life chasing an impossibility . . .”

He held the journal over one of the candles and set its pages aflame, ignoring cries of protest from both Ulrin and Cryaliss. Once the pages were caught afire, he tossed the journal away. Ulrin rushed to the burning book and beat at the flames with his cloak to extinguish them, but it was too late. From the ash leaking out from between the covers, it was clear the pages were beyond the point of salvage.

“There was nothing there that could have aided you, anyway,” Gerevin said. “The Matrons were on the right course but had yet to draw the right conclusions. Following their notes would have just led to your demise.”

Staring at the remains of the journal, the information that he had traveled so far for, nearly died for, now reduced to smoldering ash, Ulrin snapped. “You bastard! How dare you!”

His body moved faster than his mind. Somewhere, he was aware of Cryaliss shouting at him to stop, but his rage had no control. He rushed at Gerevin, Silverlight poised to stab him in the throat.

Like the strike of a cobra, Gerevin reached out and grabbed Ulrin’s wrist, stopping the blade mere inches from its target. His grip was like a vise, and his strength was far beyond anything Ulrin could hope to match. Though he was so close, he could not force his arm forward even one inch.

“How foolish,” Gerevin taunted. “However have you survived this long with such poor impulses? Perhaps I can spare just enough time to teach my foolish younger brother a lesson.”

There was a crack as Gerevin squeezed down on Ulrin’s wrist, breaking it. Ulrin screamed out in agony and was forced to drop the sword. Then came a force like being struck square on by a battering ram as Gerevin shoved Ulrin with an open palm. The impact against Ulrin’s chest caused the wind to be knocked out of him, and he was powerless to do anything as his body was sent flying backward across the room. He finally hit the back wall and felt the wood shatter from the impact. Fortunately, the wood was old and soggy and gave way easily, softening the impact somewhat. But he still hit it with enough force to knock him completely senseless.

When his wits returned, he realized he was on the ground. Cryaliss was standing over him protectively, putting herself between him and the creature. It reminded him of a mother cat protecting its young from hunters, knowing it was completely outmatched but standing in defiance, nonetheless.

“I didn’t know you garnered such loyalty, Ulrin,” Gerevin goaded. “Perhaps father was wrong about your lack of leadership qualities.”

Ulrin tried to pick himself up from the floor but accidentally put weight on his broken wrist, and the room momentarily went white with pain.

“Now, if only we could do something about your impulsiveness,” Gerevin continued. He stepped over to where Silverlight now lay. “Is this what is making you imprudently bold? This is an artifact of our dynasty, is it not? What was it called? Ah, yes, Silverlight.”

Ulrin watched in despair as Gerevin picked up Silverlight, the one and only thing Ulrin had to show for five years of struggle. Now he threatened to take it, just as he had taken the only chance to use the works of the Matrons.

“An interesting weapon,” Gerevin said, holding the sword high. “Glimmersteel supposedly has some fascinating properties. It’s a shame I never had an opportunity to study it properly.”

As he held the sword up, the silver stream that ran down the length of the blade seemed to pulse. At the tip of the blade, where the stream formed droplets that had never fallen, a droplet fell. The tiny bead of silver dripped from the blade and landed on the back of Gerevin’s hand. There was a sizzling sound akin to meat held over an open flame, and Gerevin recoiled, dropping the blade. Silverlight landed tip down, its blade sinking several inches into the stone floor before coming to a rest.

Gerevin held his injured hand in the other, a wisp of smoke rising from it. “A trap? No, Ulrin is not clever enough to set up something like that. Some inherent property of the Glimmersteel, then. Though not one I had ever read about.”

Ulrin tried again and, this time, succeeded in getting back to his feet. He gritted his teeth as he faced off with his former brother.

The heir to the throne tsked and turned his back. “I’ve wasted enough time. You are free to the dregs of this place if you wish it, though I doubt you will find much of value. I have cleared it of Corrupted, though. If you want my brotherly advice, give up on your fool’s errand of slaying Vangress and remain here. The king is well beyond your reach, and nothing you will find here or anywhere else will make it any different. Be grateful you have yet been allowed to live, and do not further tempt fate.”

He walked toward the door and stopped just before stepping outside. “Oh, in case something so obvious was lost on you, do not follow me. If you become an impediment to my work, I will kill you.”

With that, Gerevin left the temple without so much as a glance behind at his brother.

Ulrin was left hurt, in every sense of that word, and with a mind full of troubling questions. But one stood out above all the others: What had his brother become?`,

      title: "Chapter 10",
      content: `It felt strange to be back in the temple. Wrong. After what she had done, just stepping foot here felt like she was blaspheming on sacred ground. She could feel the walls accusing her, reminding her that they had seen everything and knew her sins.

Cryaliss wanted to run and leave this place behind forever. It had been a mistake to even return. As a Maiden, she thought she could have helped, but she had been completely useless to Maxwell, or rather, to Prince Ulrin. She couldn’t act as the voice of reason and get him to turn back from walking into extreme danger. She hadn’t been able to lead him to the answers he sought. And she had been helpless as he had confronted his brother. All she could do was put a splint on his wrist to aid in its healing.

Ulrin hadn’t said anything since Gerevin left. He had just sat in silence as she treated his wrist, and he’d been sitting in the same spot since. Her attempts to speak with him didn’t elicit any responses.

He’s in shock, she had realized. So much had happened to him just a few minutes ago. Learning that his brother was alive but had become Corrupted. Not just any Corrupted, but a powerful one that retained its sentience, but seemingly not its morality. He’d been insulted and beaten. He’d watched as that which he had risked everything to find was destroyed in front of him. He needed time to process everything.

Cryaliss just hoped not too much time. She didn’t want to remain here any longer than was absolutely necessary.

She remembered how she was after the attack on the temple. She’d sat on the shore of the river for over a day, wrapped in her robes, quietly watching the water pass by. It was only after exhaustion had its say and forced her to sleep for a few hours that she decided she needed to move on.

For now, she just had to be patient with Ulrin. Perhaps if she was a better person, a more complete person, she would know how to help him. Know the right words to say to help him work through his trauma. But as usual, she was useless. All she could do was wait for him.

Even if waiting here brought back her own trauma.

She decided to take a look around in case the Matrons had left something else behind that Gerevin had missed. If she could find something to make this expedition less of a waste, maybe it would take some of the sting out of the rest of the events.

To get up to the Matrons’ quarters, first, she had to pass through the dormitories. Refining the Blud took a heavy toll on the Maidens’ bodies, leaving them exhausted and drained. It was not unusual for a Maiden to spend a week in bed to recuperate from a single hour of Bludsifting, so the beds in the dormitories were made comfortable. The fluffy beds had always been a stark contrast to the hard and ancient furniture used in the rest of the temple. Even now, the beds seemed to be in a far better state than their surroundings.

In order to minimize the cumulative toll on an individual Maiden, they alternated who had been on refinement duty. If you were not on refinement duty, there were other tasks that needed to be performed around the temple. Cryaliss had not been good at much. She couldn’t cook, was too slow at cleaning, and wasn’t strong enough for physically demanding tasks. In needlework and medicine, she was proficient, though she would never claim to be a talent, and those were not tasks with a constant need. When there were no chores suitable for her, they would just tell her to pass the time here in the dormitory. She would sit by the window and wait to be needed.

Her sisters would see her there and tell her she should enjoy her free time. Use it to read, journal, or play cards. But she didn’t think it would be right for her to use her time for leisure when the others were working, so she would sit quietly and wait. And if someone did call upon her for a task, she would jump to it and give it her best effort.

The chair by the window was still in its customary spot. Some of her sisters had liked to jokingly refer to it as “The Seat of Cryaliss,” like it was some kind of holy relic because she spent so much time there. Its presence had been one of the constants of her life.

Before moving on, she smashed the chair against the wall. Nothing bearing her name, even in passing, deserved to remain in place here.

She walked past the dormitories, the kitchens, and the library and took the stairs up to the second floor. The landing was supposed to be blocked by a sealed door so that only the Matrons could open it, preventing unauthorized access to the Refining Chamber. That door, however, was smashed to bits and left scattered across the ground. Its seals were not strong enough to protect it from the fury of the Corrupted.

The refinement chamber was nearly unrecognizable. The walls were scratched and cracked, the triangular emblems on the ground had been torn up, and the wells had been smashed and reduced to rubble. The vials of BludSeed that hung on the shelves had cracked open and leaked sticky black fluid across the walls. They had been created centuries ago from the glands of the last dragons. Without them, no further Drakenblud could be produced. Not that anyone would want to these days.

The only thing that seemed to have survived the devastation was The Sifting Channel itself. It was a long white basin, reminiscent of a bathtub, if a bathtub stretched the length of a room. Forged using dragon bone, it was stronger than steel and the only known substance that could contain raw Drakenblud without melting, bursting into flames, or starting to morph. Small grooves along its top had allowed the Maidens to safely and comfortably expose their arms to the blood for hour-long Bludsifting stretches in which perfect stillness had been required.

Cryaliss intently did not look inside the Channel as she passed it. She knew that what it contained now wasn’t Blud. It was the bodies of her sisters.

At the very end of the floor were the Matrons’ quarters. Cryaliss braced herself for what she knew she would see beyond.

The corpses of the Matrons lined the wall. Spikes as thick as Cryaliss’s wrist impaled them through their guts and hung them there like décor. Though five years had seen their bodies decay beyond recognition, there was no questioning to whom those robes belonged.

She took a breath and forced herself to look away from the walls to search the room. Like in the Refining Chamber, the room had been ravaged during the attack. The furniture had been smashed, the windows broken up, and the books and art torn to shreds. It didn’t seem likely that anything of import had survived. It was actually amazing that Gerevin had found the journal intact at all. Why was it alone spared the creatures’ wrath?

Despite the poor odds, she set herself to sifting through the rubble to find something of value. No luck at first as she dug through torn pages from a cookbook, some experiment notes that had been soaked with so much blood as to be illegible, and slivers from the painting of the temple’s founder. The room smelled of rot and death, assaulting her senses and increasing her desire to flee. But she persisted.

Finally, her patience was rewarded, as beneath the splinters of a wardrobe, a piece of brass caught her eye. It appeared like a piece of cheap jewelry at first, but when she pulled it free, she found a round locket with the distinctive crimson triangle of the temple. She recognized the artifact at once.

It wasn’t much, but it could certainly be an aid in journeying through the fallen kingdom.

Excited at her discovery and glad to be able to leave, she rushed downstairs to show her find to Ulrin. Hopefully, this would be enough to break his stupor.

As she passed by the library, she heard the sounds of shuffling inside. Cautiously, she approached the door to the archive and peeked inside. She found that Ulrin did not need her aid after all.

By the light of a candle, Ulrin was picking through the books on the shelves, cracking them open, then replacing them. It was technically a crime to allow anyone but the Maidens to access the texts in this library, but Cryaliss thought she could make an exception.

“Glad to see you are up and about again, Ul— er, Maxwell,” she said.

He arched an eyebrow at her. “I think we’re a little bit past the alias, aren’t we? You got a good listen of everything that happened between me and my brother.”

“I’m sorry. In truth, I knew your identity for some time. While you slept, you said the words ‘brother’ and ‘Gerevin’ quite a lot. It’s not exactly a common name. That and your hair . . . it was pretty obvious who you were.”

He grumbled, “So, you just let me make a fool of myself by going along with my false identity?”

“No! No, it’s not like that. I just— I know a thing or two about having secrets. I figured there was a good reason you wanted to hide who you were and was worried you might be uncomfortable if you knew I was aware of your identity. Besides, it matters little to me whether you wish to go by Maxwell or Ulrin.”

“It was just an act of caution. A lot of the people I’ve met over the past few years blame my family for The Bleeding and all the shit that has come with it. Honestly, I don’t know anymore whether they are right or wrong about that. But I do know that if I want to survive, and I want to do it without leaving a trail of dead in my wake, it’s better to hide who I am.”

She hadn’t considered how rough that must have been, but she understood it all too well. Everywhere she went, people didn’t trust her because she was a Blood Maiden. Some had even blamed her. Desperate people were always looking for someone to be at fault for their misery.

“I take no offense at the deception,” she responded. “Though now that I am openly aware of your title, do you want to be referred to as Prince, or Your Highness, or . . .”

“Don’t you dare. Just Ulrin is fine.”

She smiled, showing that she was just teasing. “So, Just Ulrin, is there something specific you are looking for? I’m quite familiar with the library. Maybe I can help.”

He shrugged. “Three hands are better than one, I suppose, though as to what I’m looking for, it’s kind of an ‘I’ll know it when I see it’ kind of situation. My lead here went up in flames, literally, but there’s got to be something else. In my research at the Library of Vel’Diel, I learned the Blood Maidens were often tasked with identifying artifacts excavated from Draconic ruins with suspected mystical properties. I know it’s kind of a stretch, but maybe one of these artifacts could have its use combating the Corrupted. After all, the Corrupted are fueled by Drakenblud. And there’s got to be a record of these artifacts and where they were sent somewhere in here.”

Cryaliss thought for a minute. “We didn’t get many new artifacts during my time here. My understanding was there hadn’t been much left to excavate from the ruins these days. Most of our records are probably pretty dated. But I do remember something passing through here. Let me see if I can figure out where that ledger would be.”

She joined in his search, directing him to the corner of the archive where the most recent records of incoming and outgoing shipments were made. They began to scan the meticulously taken notes for anything that stood out.

“How are you feeling?” Cryaliss decided to ask as they read side-by-side. “I know you just experienced a lot. If you want to talk about it—”

“I see no reason to dwell on what happened,” Ulrin interrupted in a heightened tone. “I have to press on. There is no other choice.”

“Press on with your goal of killing your father?”

“He’s not my father anymore. Just a massive Corrupted, responsible for killing most of my family, my friends, and setting my home ablaze. Slaying him might not undo any of the damage, but revenge is as good a goal as any.”

“It’s important to have a goal to focus on,” she agreed somberly. “I know all too well how easy it is to get lost in despair when you have no direction and no home to return to.”

His voice softened. “My apologies. You lost just as much as I did and don’t need my self-pity to add to yours. I don’t know if it will help, but if you know the identity of whoever is responsible for the assault on your temple and would like to have your own revenge, I would be happy to assist.”

“I appreciate the sentiment. But I am afraid that the only one responsible for the death of my sisters is myself.”

Ulrin turned to face her. She could feel his cinder eyes studying her, looking for the truth in her words. He would not find any deception in her.

Fortunately, he did not press her on the matter. She did not think she could stand to give the whole story. Not here. Not yet. They let the conversation drop and returned to their search.

They finally found what they were looking for. A ledger book had a recent entry detailing a mysterious device excavated from a Draconic ruin that had the markings of the Dragonslayers on it. The Matrons had been unable to identify it but theorized it was a weapon of some kind. After they surrendered to it, they had it shipped to the University for further study by its scholars. That had been dated a few months before The Bleeding. If nobody else had looted it, it was likely still there.

“The University, huh?” Ulrin said as he put down the ledger. “That’s all the way in the Highlands. Quite a trip from here and one that passes straight through the Heartlands.”

“I have not been out that far myself,” Cryaliss admitted. “Do you know how bad that region’s gotten?”

“Bad. That whole region was heavily urbanized. The road that led up toward the mountain paths was surrounded by densely populated cities in the kingdom. I’ve made a couple of scouting trips to get an understanding of the region, and each time I had to quickly retreat due to spotting a massive roaming horde of Corrupted. Getting through the region to even reach the University is going to be a whole ’nother level of challenge.”

“Maybe not.” She reached into her robe and produced the locket. “I found this in the Matrons’ quarters. It may help us reach our destination safely.”

Ulrin watched curiously as she flipped open the locket, revealing a compass. The arrow was floating in a shimmering blue liquid, and the dial replaced the cardinal directions with “Forward,” “Back,” “Left,” and “Right.”

“This is known as the Pathfinder,” she explained. “If you place it on a map, it will guide you to the safest route to that spot.”

“Safest route? You mean it somehow knows which path to take to avoid dangers?”

“I’m afraid I don’t really know how the magic works,” Cryaliss admitted. “It belonged to one of the Matrons as her prized possession. But she showed it to me a few times and demonstrated placing it on a map. According to her stories, if they could be believed, scouts used to be able to use it to avoid the patrols of flying dragons. Maybe it can also help us avoid hordes of wandering Corrupted.”

“Worth a shot, at least. Worst-case scenario, it leads up to our death.”

Ulrin took the library’s map, then returned to the main hall to lay it flat on the table. Cryaliss placed the compass on the University in the Highlands, and they both watched as the needle slowly turned until it came to rest on a bearing.

“Well, it seems to be doing something,” Ulrin said. “Let’s see where this leads us.”

They prepared for the next part of their journey together and soon were departing the Temple of the Blood Maidens.

Hopefully, for the last time, Cryaliss thought.

Before she left, she stopped for a moment to look back at those words written in Draconic between the arched passageways:

“From one drop of blood, life is granted,

From one drop of blood, life is taken,

From one drop of blood,

The truth is found.”

The mantra of the Blood Maidens, symbolic of their pride in their legacy.

Now, she was all that remained. She was the sole heir of that legacy. And she was not worthy.

But she would keep trying to be until the last drop of her blood had been spilled.`,

      content: `He was so close to a breakthrough. The secrets of the Pentahedron were just outside of his grasp, but they would not elude his genius for long. All he needed was time, patience, and . . .

Some damn quiet, Bayliff thought, as the pounding on his walls started up again.

He lifted his thick spectacles to rub at the bridge of his nose. Another headache was coming on. They were growing more frequent. The lack of sleep, long hours of reading, and general stress were getting to him. But worse still were these incessant sessions of hammering.

It was clear the Corrupted had discovered his sanctuary once more. Sometimes the racket could be ascribed to the general destructive nature of the creatures and their hobby of demolishing any semblance of civilization they stumbled across. But when it was this frequent, it meant that one of them had managed to sense him, and now they were trying to find a way to break their way in.

Not that Bayliff was in any immediate danger. The lab he had converted into his workspace and living quarters had been part of the High Explosives Research Project. Its walls were built strong enough to withstand an accidental discharge of powerful chemicals. The claws and fangs of the Corrupted were not going to be able to break through, and so far, none of the creatures had shown the intelligence to work the complicated system of locks he had set on the entry.

But while they were not a danger, they were incredibly annoying. How was he expected to get any work done under these conditions? The fate of humanity, or what was left of it, rested in his brilliant mind. These distractions hurt everyone.

In an ideal situation, he would have assistants to deal with the problem so he could focus on his work. Unfortunately, he was the last one left. Well, the last one with his sanity intact, anyway.

There used to be six of them. While most of the students and staff had fled the University when it got overrun, Bayliff’s team had stayed to finish their research. Most of them were now out there with the creatures. Though poor Bjorn was probably still stuck in the library.

What Bayliff wouldn’t give to have access to the library himself right now. But he hadn’t been able to get to that side of the University since that idiot Carmine had tried to open the path to the dorms. Some idiotic noble notion of rescuing students still trapped inside. All he had done was get himself killed and cost them access to the west wing. Bayliff had grabbed all the books on esoteric geometry he could carry before retreating into the labs, as his theories surrounding the Pentahedron focused on that area at the time. He had since learned that the powers of the Pentahedron were more likely centered around a converted BludSeed. Unfortunately, all the books that might give him more insight were just beyond his reach.

He was certain he could complete his research with or without that, given some time. But only if given a moment’s peace!

Well, if he needed something done, he would have to do it himself.

First, a short break to rebuild his strength. He rose with an effort, the tingling in his feet alerting him to just how long he had been seated. With a groan, he shook his legs to try to get the blood flowing.

While his mind was unparalleled, he was aware of the limitations of his body. He’d never been what one would consider “athletic.” He was short and thickset, his body all soft and flappy from a life spent in study instead of in physical activity. Some of his peers had lived by a philosophy that a healthy body was important for a healthy mind and spent much of their time at the University’s athletic facilities. Bayliff considered it time wasted. And in the end, their fitness had not helped them survive.

Still, the condition of his body offered some unfortunate challenges. Such as feeling winded when climbing between the lower and upper labs. He wished he could have some words with whoever decided that the floors would only be connected by a ladder. No stairs, no ramp, just a barbaric wooden ladder. A few times, he had considered consolidating all of his resources to a single floor in order to spare himself the effort. But he needed to ensure that neither his food nor his experiments were tainting one another, so practicality demanded he keep them separate. As much of a pain as that was.

Panting, he pulled himself up onto the upper lab. This space had been reorganized as living quarters, with all the heavy equipment either pushed to the walls, moved to the lower floor, or repurposed. A pile of blankets and pillows had been stacked together to provide moderately comfortable sleeping arrangements, at least as comfortable as was possible when sleeping on a hard floor. One of the minor advantages of being the only one remaining was that he had all the comforts to himself. His back had been killing him when he had only one blanket between him and the cold stone.

He lay down for a bit, putting a pillow over his head to block out the pounding. His exhaustion took over, and he soon drifted off into blissful unconsciousness despite the racket.

When he awoke a short time later, the noise had yet to cease. If he could give the Corrupted credit for one thing, it was that they were persistent.

According to the timeglass, he had slept for about four hours. Longer than he would have liked, but his body had needed it.

After performing his morning biological imperative, he set to check he had enough fuel for the exertion ahead. Food supplies were running lower than he would have liked. They had used long-term preservation techniques as much as they could—smoking, salting, and jarring everything they could carry from the kitchens—but even then, they had known they were operating on a strict time limit unless they could get some fresh food in. Using waste as compost, they had managed to cultivate a few plants that could grow without sunlight, including mushrooms and white asparagus. The yields were small, more of a way to stretch their supplies than replace them. Now that he was alone, the small crops went much further. Another minor advantage.

On the off chance he’d finally had some luck, he checked his traps near the ventilation holes. He’d kill for a little fresh meat in his diet, even if it was just rat meat.

He remembered the first time they had caught one of the bastards squeezing through the tiny air holes near the top of the bottom floor. There had been much debate about the risks of consuming it. As far as they had observed, only humans were affected by the Blood Rain, but that didn’t mean the rats couldn’t serve as carriers for the disease, as they had so many sicknesses in the past. They ended up dissecting it and performing a few experiments, coming to the tentative conclusion that the meat was likely safe so long as it was cleaned and cooked thoroughly. Even then, they were hesitant, not least because the idea of eating rat meat was disgusting. Hunger eventually triumphed over such concerns.

It had been a while since Bayliff had last seen one, though, and once again, he found his trap empty. Perhaps the University was no longer conducive to their breeding. Or maybe the Corrupted had started to hunt them, though he had never seen them attack anything other than a non-Corrupted human.

No point in wasting further brainpower on pondering it. He settled on a couple of slices of jarred bread, a small picking of mushrooms, and some salt-preserved greens. Not a tasty meal, but enough to keep him going another day.

Now that he was rested and fed, he could commit himself fully to eliminating those nuisances impeding his work.

Returning to the bottom floor, he made his way into the back room, where all the more volatile chemicals had been stashed. When they had first made this lab their safe house, Bayliff’s peers had wanted to dispose of all the more dangerous substances, sighting the risks of an accident setting all their work up in flames, literally. But Bayliff had insisted that their potential benefits outweighed the risk and had personally overseen their placement in stable, long-term storage.

It was a good thing he did. Otherwise, he would have no way of clearing the hordes when they got too nosey. Thanks to his far-sightedness, he was able to produce a decent supply of Irimian firebombs. He wouldn’t give the people of Irimire much credit for their contributions to the true sciences, but he would admit that they were advanced in the art of blowing things up. Not that Bayliff didn’t think he could do the same, but his mind was always occupied with more important research.

In order to keep the components in a non-reactive state, he kept them in separate containers and stored them on opposing shelves. For ease of construction of the firebombs, they were all pre-portioned in the exact measurements needed for the most effective blast. From there, it was just a matter of putting them in order into the shells. It required a steady hand to combine them without them either blowing up in his face or neutralizing one of the agents. Fortunately, his hands were among the steadiest in the kingdom.

Grayscale powder. Bitterwater. Blasting stones. Frost oil. With those four ingredients together, the reaction was prepped. The rest of the shell was filled with fine sand that would provide stability to the mixture even if the shell got shaken a bit. It wouldn’t be a good idea to drop the thing suddenly, but it should withstand some light jostling while on his person. Finally, a fuse was inlaid before the shell was sealed. In a pinch, he could detonate the firebombs just by tossing them hard enough, but he needed to light the fuse if he wouldn’t want to experience the full force of the reaction.

He decided to craft three of the firebombs. It might be overkill, but it was better to be prepared. And it wasn’t like he was running low on ingredients.

All that was left now was to do it. He put on his researcher’s coat, composed of white and red fabric with thick layers of specially treated leather designed to protect against the most common laboratory hazards, including chemical spills or flying shrapnel. It wouldn’t protect him from a direct hit from the Corrupted’s claws, but it was better than nothing. He tucked the firebombs into three of the coat’s many pockets and positioned them so they were somewhat secure.

He needed to get the entry cleared if he was going to be able to leave without immediately getting cut down. There was a simple trick he had figured out the last time he had needed to do it that took advantage of the Corrupted’s primitive instincts. It might still be effective unless they had learned since then. Only one way to find out.

Bayliff grabbed a metal pipe and started banging it on the wall furthest from the door. Sure enough, just a few moments later, he could hear the sounds of the Corrupted swarming around that area. They slammed against the wall as they tried to find a way inside to get to him.

Once he was convinced that the majority of his hunters had moved to that side, he quietly unlatched the front entry and prepared to make his way out. Unfortunately, the heavy door was impossible to open silently. As soon as he pushed it open, he would be pursued. There would be no room for mistakes.

Not an issue. Perfection was his job.

He pushed the heavy door open and started to run. Well, briskly jog, as his endurance would allow. Almost immediately, he heard the shrieks, howls, and twisted screaming. The hunters knew he was out and were coming for him.

It was a short trip through the lab wing corridors to the University’s northern courtyard. One turn took him down past rows of dead gardens, another through the remains of an outdoor leisure area. Estimating by the rate of the sounds of his pursuers getting closer, he was moving at just the right speed to reach his destination before they caught up to him as he rounded the last corner.

There was a loud crash as a massive figure impacted a tree to his right. The decorative tree had been mostly dead due to the lack of sunlight, and this sudden weight was more than its weakened bark could take. It cracked and splintered before coming crashing down in Bayliff’s direction. He had to dive out of the way, a feat that was not easy for him, to avoid being crushed. As he hit the ground, he worried that the sudden jolt would detonate his firebombs. He braced himself for an explosion.

When he found himself blessedly intact, he quickly picked himself up and continued down the final stretch. The massive figure from before leaped from the shattered remains of the tree and landed with a significant thud not far behind him. Bayliff did not need to look back to know what he was dealing with. A Leaper, a Corrupted that largely resembled a hybrid between a human and a toad. The body was engorged to twice its previous size, with much of that extra mass forming elongated and powerful legs. It would use those legs to jump after and atop its chosen prey. Like many other Corrupted, it possessed fangs and claws, but its preferred method of execution was to stomp on its victim until its weight reduced them to mush.

Bayliff would not be able to outrace this thing to his destination. Seeing little recourse, he withdrew one of the firebombs from his coat. He waited until he heard the creature leap, then turned and chucked the explosive with all the strength he could muster. His aim wasn’t particularly good, but it hardly mattered when dealing with a creature this size. The firebomb caught the side of the Corrupted as it was descending, and the sudden jolt caused a detonation.

The sky was briefly lit by shimmering red flame as the creature’s body was engulfed in the blast. It let out an inhuman shriek as it crashed into the ground. It flailed and rolled about, attempting to put out the flame, but Irimian fire was not so easily extinguished. That was part of what made it so dangerous.

He did not have time to celebrate his minor victory or ensure the creature would properly die. In the light cast by the flames, he could see the outlines of the rest of his pursuers rapidly approaching. Thankfully, he did not have too much further to go.

Just a short jog later, he reached the hatch leading down into the old maintenance tunnel. The tunnel had connected the courtyards to the laborer housing and had been used mainly by the groundskeepers who maintained the gardens and the outdoor facilities. Now it served as a perfect deathtrap.

He pulled open the hatch and took the stone steps that led down two at a time. The rock walls were charred black from the last time he had performed this specific maneuver. He ran down the tunnel, removing his remaining firebombs and lighting their fuses as he went. Behind him, he could hear the wails and scrambling as the Corrupted pursued him into the tunnel. He carefully dropped the two lit explosives in the tunnel, one about halfway through and the other closer to the end. He reached and climbed the steps leading up to the apartments and pushed shut the hatch behind him. There was just enough time to lock the latch before the first blast shook the ground, followed closely by a second. He could faintly make out the screams of the Corrupted on the other side of the hatch as the explosion tore them apart. The dimensions and conditions of the tunnel made it a perfect funnel for the flames, and a rush of hot air pushed through the cracks in the hatch as fire engulfed its length.

Bayliff walked through the courtyards back across the distance the tunnel had taken him, carefully keeping his eyes and ears open for any Corrupted nearby that had not followed him below. He did not see anything and was able to reach the hatch he had first entered unimpeded. This one he also shut and locked, trapping anything still alive down in the tunnel. Some Corrupted were more resistant to fire than others, and it was necessary to ensure they burned until they were truly dead. The Irimian fire would continue to burn for a while yet, so even if something had managed to avoid the brunt of the explosion, they would all burn in time.

With the job complete, Bayliff found cover in a private-study alcove and took a moment to catch his breath. Overall, not a poor performance. While he doubted he had managed to lure all the nuisances from this part of the University into his trap, it should at least reduce their numbers. For a while, anyway. There always seemed to be more of them.

Encountering the Leaper had been dangerous. He’d need to adjust his route next time so that he wouldn’t have to rely on his reflexes to avoid falling trees. But overall, it could have gone worse. At least he hadn’t encountered the Master. These days, it only seemed to roam the offices, but it was still a concern whenever Bayliff left the security of his lab.

Once he felt he had recovered enough, he began to silently make his way back to his lab.

Screams cut through the silence and caught his attention. Human screams. He took a moment to ascertain their point of origin. They seemed to come from beyond the gates, in the direction of the dorms, the housing for the students who didn’t have the status or money to live within the campus itself.

He was surprised anyone out there could possibly still be alive. The dorms had been incredibly crowded, which made them a nightmare during The Bleeding when many of its occupants had been turned. Even before the University itself had fallen, the decision had been made to seal to gates to keep the creatures from the dorms from overrunning the campus. When the ill-fated Carmine had attempted to open a path around the gates to save any surviving students, the number of Corrupted that had flooded in just in a few minutes had been enough to cost them the west wing of the University, including access to the library.

But perhaps Carmine had the right idea, just the wrong motivations. If the survivors in the dorms could be guided into the University, they could provide him with exactly what he needed to get back to the library: a distraction.

As he returned to the lab and sealed it tight, new plans were already forming in his mind.`,

      title: "Chapter 12",
      content: `Ulrin had harbored doubts about the supposed mystical properties of the device Cryaliss called the Pathfinder, but there was no denying the results. The University was on the other side of the kingdom from the Aspya Stretch, and the route crossed the densely populated region known as the Heartlands. He expected to run into a wandering horde or roaming hunters around every bend in the road, yet weeks passed without any sign of danger.

The compass on the Pathfinder had taken them on a few strange detours. When they reached The Dragonslayer’s Path, a river that separated the Heartlands from the Reaches, the needle made them go north for several miles, passing back several bridges and crossings, before finally directing them to cross at a rough shallow. Days later, it had them hugging the southern coast, taking them all the way to the region about Icury, which Ulrin knew to be swarming with Corrupted. It guided them clear of the town itself, but did direct them to a nearby deserted village, where they found some preserves to add to their supplies. A welcome addition to their dwindling rations.

Eventually, they were led to a mountain path that would take them up into the Highlands and, ultimately, the University. Sixteen straight days of travel without encountering a single Corrupted. Far too long for it to be simply luck.

As they neared their destination, Ulrin remembered his first time seeing the University. As a prince, he was expected to spend several years at the University to ensure he would be a properly educated ruler. The tour he had taken of the campus had been led by the Master of Students and had the goal of introducing him to the various facilities and areas of focused study he could choose. Ulrin had been dreading enrollment, and the tour had only confirmed that he was due for a dull and stressful time.

Seeing the University for the first time, he had likened it to a massive birdcage. An incredibly complex net of spindly metal covered the campus in a bizarre dome. The only way through past and into the campus was through elaborate gates that were raised by opening a channel in the man-made river that flowed around the exterior of the campus so that the water would act as a counterweight to the mechanism. The channel then needed to be drained to re-close the gate. When asked about the impracticality of the design, the Master of Students had told Ulrin that everything had been built as a testimony to their mastery of the physical sciences, that the great metal sky and the gates each represented the power of engineering over the perceived limitations of the world. It had still seemed so silly then, a hilarious waste of money and space with flimsy justification.

Now, seeing the University again for the first time in years, it appeared far more imposing. The steel dome that had once seemed like a pointless and ugly blight on the skyline now seemed like a foreboding labyrinth. The wiry frame was now a dark monolith, the lair of deadly creatures that threatened any who came near. It was a cage that should never be opened. And he was about to go inside.

“It’s huge,” Cryaliss said. “Was this really a place of learning? It seems more like a fortress. Or . . . perhaps a prison.”

Ulrin grunted in agreement. “I can’t imagine anyone wanting to attend here.”

“But they did.”

“Everyone did. At least in the circles I ran in. The facilities were unmatched, the professors were the greatest in their field, and the library was filled with knowledge that couldn’t be found anywhere else in the world. At least, that’s what everyone liked to say.”

“You sound like you don’t agree?” Cryaliss noted.

“Well, I never attended myself. Wasn’t old enough yet. I only got the tour. My brother spoke highly of his time here and how much he’d learned. My mother always made a big deal of my education, and there was a lot of pressure on me from my family to figure out my area of study to be ready for my time here, as it was to be such an instrumental part of my education. And yet I had met many children of nobles whom I would consider to be . . . less than intellectual. Not to be too arrogant about it, as I myself struggled with my studies, but some of the upper class couldn’t dress themselves if they didn’t have servants to do it for them.”

“Sort of ironic to hear a prince judge the other nobility. I assumed you were so wealthy, your servants would have servants.”

Ulrin shrugged. “I suppose I deserve that for hiding my identity for so long. I did have servants, but I didn’t like to rely on them. It made me uncomfortable to have others do stuff for me that I could do myself.”

Cryaliss flushed. “I’m sorry! I didn’t actually mean . . . It was my attempt at humor! I figured, I mean, you’re so capable, of course, you would—”

“It’s fine. The point I was trying to make was that I think many people just wanted to go to the University because of the prestige it offered rather than any pursuit of knowledge.” He took another look at the imposing structure. “Though for those who did care to learn, it was the jewel of the kingdom. Now it’s just another ruin, another reminder of all we lost.”

“I never saw the world outside the temple,” Cryaliss replied. “I wish I could have gotten to see the great sights from back then.”

Ulrin scratched the back of his head. “I guess it’s my turn to apologize. Sometimes when I talk, I forget we lived very different lives.”

“Our worlds might have been different, but we both lost them. Now we inhabit this one.”

The pair approached the front entry path and soon encountered the first challenge of the journey: The gate was closed. This wasn’t totally unpredicted. The University would have sealed the gates in case of an emergency, and the end of the world would have certainly counted. Ulrin had hoped that the gates would have been left open by students or teachers that would have fled the University during the chaos. But no such luck.

“We’ll have to find the outer channel controls to get this gate raised,” Ulrin explained. “Unfortunately, I’m not positive where they are. The gate would usually be operated by the internal tower. The exterior one was a backup for emergencies, and it would be hidden to keep bad actors from accessing it.”

“The area surrounding the campus is huge,” Cryaliss said. “We could be searching for weeks without even covering half that ground.”

“It shouldn’t be quite that impossible. It would be in one of the secured areas, and it would have to be close enough to the mechanisms of the channel to be able to manipulate them. It will require a bit of searching, but I’m confident we should find it in a few days with a bit of luck.”

“If you say so. Hopefully, our good fortune avoiding the Corrupted lasts until then.” She looked up at the sky. “We may have to wait to start our search, though. I sense a Blood Rain is coming.”

Ulrin followed her gaze upward. He couldn’t see any signs of coming rain, but he had come to trust her instincts over the past few weeks when it came to such things. Part of her strange Blood Maiden gifts, he supposed.

“The dorms aren’t far from here,” he said. “We probably shouldn’t go too far in, as they’re likely swarming with the Corrupted forms of the former students. But there are buildings on the outskirts that could be safe. Let’s be careful and find some cover.”

They headed off down the road, keeping low to avoid being seen by wandering Corrupted. They moved along silently, listening for any sounds that suggested danger. Overhead, red clouds began to fill the darkened sky, foretelling the rain that Cryaliss had predicted.

When they reached the edge of the path, Cryaliss stopped and pointed toward a large building that was mostly obscured by the darkness. Considering the circumstances, it was in surprisingly good shape, and there were no signs of Corrupted nearby.

“This looks like the safest place in the area. Doors still secured, windows aren’t broken,” she said.

Ulrin nodded and began moving toward the door. “Still could be enemies inside. Let’s take this cautiously.”

She nodded and followed behind him. As they neared the doors, they heard noises from within.

“Could it be another survivor?” Cryaliss asked.

“Either that or a Corrupted that’s going to burst through that door as soon as it hears it.” Ulrin drew his sword. “Not smart to sneak up on survivors on edge, either. We could try to find another place to hide, or we could try to announce ourselves and see what happens.”

“Hello?” Cryaliss called out tentatively, making the decision for both of them.

There was no response, but they continued to approach anyway.

“Are you in there? We’re looking for shelter,” Cryaliss continued.

There was no reply, but the noise ceased suddenly, and they stepped inside.

From the outside, the building appeared to be in relatively good condition. The walls were intact, the roof had not caved in, and the glass windows were undamaged. Inside, however, was a completely different story. The building had clearly been abandoned for a long time. The dust on the floor had turned to mud, and the furniture was covered in grime. The air was heavy with the scent of mildew and decay.

“This place looks like it’s been empty since before The Bleeding,” Cryaliss remarked. “This is more than a few years of dust buildup.”

“Strange. I’d imagine real estate around the University would be at a premium. Why let such a large building go to waste?”

“I’m afraid whoever might have been able to answer that question is likely long gone.”

They slowly made their way down the hallways, checking each room carefully. The first room they came upon was empty, but the second was filled with the remains of someone who had not taken kindly to the end of the world.

“He took his own life,” Cryaliss said as she examined the body, her voice laden with a deep sadness. “The knife wounds on his wrist are unmistakable.”

“A better end than most have experienced these last few years,” Ulrin said.

“You would call this better?”

“Just speaking relatively. A quick end by your choice, rather than being torn apart by your former friends. Or worse, becoming one of those things yourself and having to witness yourself doing the tearing.”

What Gerevin had said had stuck with him, gnawing at the back of his mind. That the people who became Corrupted were somehow still conscious, still aware of their actions. What it must be like to watch powerlessly as you violently murder your loved ones.

Cryaliss went quiet. Well, Ulrin was used to Cryaliss being quiet. Though she had started speaking more than when they had first met, she still didn’t speak much. Ulrin didn’t know if she was just shy or if that was how Blood Maidens were. But this was a different sort of quiet. It was heavy.

“Sorry if I offended you,” Ulrin said, desperate to clear the air with the first traveling companion he’d had in a long time. “I don’t mean to make light of someone’s death. I was just . . . thinking aloud.”

“I understand.” Her tone was somber, not angry. “I’ve had similar thoughts. I just feel it is best not to give them power by voicing them, is all. They’re dangerous.”

“Yeah.” It was chilling how right she was.

“So young. He couldn’t have been a student here long. I . . . Would you mind if I took the time to perform rites for the deceased? I know it might seem silly, given how much death we encounter, but . . .”

“We should make sure the rest of the building is secure,” Ulrin responded. “Once we are certain we are safe, I think it would be more than appropriate.”

She nodded and followed him as they continued their search of the building.

They cleared the back rooms, which were in a similar state to the front. There was no sign of anything alive or moving about.

“Place seems empty,” Ulrin said. “That’s a stroke of good luck. Though I am uncertain about those noises we heard.”

“Maybe the wind had gotten inside?” Cryaliss said, hopefully.

Ulrin wasn’t so certain, but he also couldn’t find any evidence to suggest otherwise. “I’ll do another pass to make sure the doors and windows are all properly secured. You can go perform the rites for the deceased if you wish.”

She nodded. “Thank you. I’ll meet you in the main room when I’m done.”

Ulrin braced a chair against the handle of the front door and ensured the windows were all properly sealed and blocked so that the lights they were using couldn’t be seen from outside. He took a peek outside as he did and saw the first drops of the crimson rain fall. By the time Cryaliss rejoined him, the rain had started to come down in full force. The old roof groaned, but it had held up against the rain this long, and there wasn’t any reason to suspect it wouldn’t this time.

“I suppose we are stuck here for the time being,” Ulrin said. “Little smelly, and some of that mold we probably should be careful not to get too close to, but overall I think we should be safe.”

“For now,” Cryaliss said. She looked around the room, then sat on one of the couches.

“We should get some sleep, then,” Ulrin said.

Cryaliss nodded. She was quiet as she pulled her robe tighter around herself and curled up on the couch. Ulrin got comfortable in his own bedroll and closed his eyes. He was tired, but sleep was slow to come. After a while, he found himself listening to Cryaliss breathe softly. He smiled to himself.

He had been careful not to let himself get too close to her. She was a traveling companion, and a useful one at that, but not a friend. Or so he liked to tell himself. It was dangerous to fully trust her. And not just because she was a Blood Maiden or because she was clearly carrying a heavy burden that she did not want to share. But because trusting anyone was dangerous these days. Even the nicest person could turn vicious when it came to their survival or someone else’s.

Yet the way Cryaliss seemed completely unguarded around him made it impossible for him to keep his own up. From their first days together, she had been comfortable falling asleep near him, completely unafraid of what he might do while she was defenseless. He had slept with one eye open those days, uncertain about her. But she had never doubted him, even when she knew he was lying about his identity. He couldn’t tell if she was that good a judge of character or just that naïve.

“Is something bothering you, Ulrin?” she surprised him by saying. “You’re staring at me a little.”

“Oh, I uh . . . thought you were asleep,” he sheepishly replied.

“Do you always stare at me while I’m sleeping?”

“No!” He looked away. “I mean, not for any weird reasons. I was just thinking, and my attention kind of drifted.”

“Thinking about what?”

“I guess I’m just still curious about your goals. We barely know each other, and yet you’ve followed me halfway across the kingdom chasing a relic that might not even be here.”

She turned on the couch to face him directly. “Is that so strange? To want to be helpful?”

“Something that’s become rare, at the very least, since everything went to shit. Most people you meet these days are more likely to shank you for your last jar of preserves than lend a hand, much less risk their lives traveling into the heart of danger.”

“It’s as safe with you as anywhere else right now,” she argued. “Safer, even, with the power of the Pathfinder and your magical sword.”

“If I believed that you were just traveling with me for added safety, then I wouldn’t have any questions,” Ulrin replied. “But you take too many risks for that to be the case. Heck, you could have been killed by my brother trying to protect me.”

Cryaliss was quiet for a moment. “I just want to be useful to somebody. Anybody. And you are here. If I bother you, I can leave you alone.”

Ulrin realized that his inability to keep his thoughts to himself was once again getting him into trouble. “No. Please, continue to assist me. I really do appreciate it, even if I’m too foolish to properly know how to express it.”

“How about you?”

“What about me?”

“Why are you so determined on the path you’re on?” Cryaliss asked. “To slay your father. You’ve admitted it will not solve anything. You could follow your brother’s advice and focus on survival. With your skills, you may even live a long while. But you travel straight toward danger on the slim chance you will find something to help you with the task you have committed yourself to.”

Ulrin sighed. “I suppose it’s not fair for me to question your motives if I’m not ready to respond about my own. I’m not even sure I have a good answer. I think part of it may be duty. Despite everything, I am a prince of Lorn, after all, and I have obligations to the royal family and our ancestral castle. But it goes beyond that.” He found himself clutching his fists and had to force himself to relax. “The day I fled the castle, I found my younger siblings. Or their remains, anyway. They had been burned beyond recognition. Only the signet rings they wore allowed me to recognize them.”

“I’m sorry. I can’t imagine how hard that must have been.”

“I’d never been that close to my younger brother and sister. Not like I was with Gerevin. They were reserved, quiet, and obedient, while I was the one who was always getting in trouble. My mother would sometimes accuse me of trying to ‘corrupt’ them when I tried to bring one of them along on my misadventures. Not that they ever agreed. They were too well-behaved for that.” He shook his head sadly. “But just because we weren’t close didn’t mean I didn’t love them. They were my family. And my father killed them.”

“So, desire for vengeance pulls you that strongly.”

“Maybe. I told you before that I seek revenge, but it doesn’t always feel like it. ‘Revenge’ and ‘vengeance’ imply a level of anger, of rage, that I just don’t feel. It’s more like . . .” He struggled to find the words. “Emptiness. Like a hole was left in me, and the only way to fill it, to make myself whole again, is to set things right for my family. To see my siblings’ killer be brought to justice.”

After thinking about it further, he added, “And for my father, too. Whatever problems I might have had with him, he doesn’t deserve to continue such a tortured existence. I hate what he’s become, but I still cling to the memories of the man he once was.”

Cryaliss sat up on the couch and looked at him. “For what it’s worth, I find your determination admirable. I only wish I could match your passion. I will do everything I can to help you.”

Such an overly wholesome statement would have been suspicious coming from anyone else, but from Cryaliss, it sounded honest. He wasn’t even sure how to respond. Should he thank her? Should he look for some way to properly return the favor?

The following silence was interrupted by a sudden noise, the same one they had heard from outside. Immediately, Ulrin was on his feet and drawing Silverlight. He scanned the room quickly, trying to find the source of the sudden disturbance. It was close.

A pair of rats skittered by his feet, eliciting him to jump. He was embarrassed when he realized what it was that had startled him. The rats scurried to the front door and squeezed themselves through a crack between the door and the frame.

“There were rats here the whole time?” Cryaliss asked. “How creepy! They could have crawled on us while we were sleeping!”

“That they were making enough noise that we could hear them from outside, I’d wager there’re more than just the two,” Ulrin said. “Probably a nest of them somewhere in here.”

“Oh, don’t say that! How I am supposed to sleep now!”

Ulrin arched an eyebrow. “Surprised it bothers you that much. Far worse things in the world these days than rats.”

“I know that! I just find them gross, is all.”

“Shame. They’re one of the few readily available meat sources nowadays. I was considering looking for their nest to catch a few.”

Cryaliss gagged. “No! Absolutely not! I’m not eating that!”

“Pity. Well, the only ones we’ve seen have run outside, and I’m not about to go chasing them, anyway.”

He stepped to a window and lifted the curtain slightly to watch the rain outside. The crimson storm was in full force, beating the windows with a torrent of sickly red liquid, like blood pouring from the wound of a god above.

Just when he was about to turn away, a glimmer of light caught his eye. Focusing on it, he was able to determine the light was coming from a set of lanterns. They swayed furiously in the storm, carried by several bundled figures moving with great speed.

“What the hell are they doing out in the Blood Rain?” Ulrin remarked. “They’re as good as dead already.”

Behind the figures, he saw the reason for the figures’ haste. A horde of Gurglers was hot on their heels, very close to overtaking them.

Individually, a Gurgler is only a small threat, at least on the scale of the Corrupted. Their bodies are still mostly human, though their flesh is twisted and rotted in places, giving them the appearance of walking corpses. Though stronger and faster than normal men, they lacked any of the claws or other deadly appendages of their peers.

What they did have was an uncanny ability to coordinate and communicate, acting almost like a single entity. Even if you managed to get one on its own, the others would still be linked to it, as Ulrin had learned the hard way when he had tried to take out what he thought to be a straggler. They traveled and hunted in massive swarms to overwhelm their prey with pure numbers. They reminded Ulrin of watching ants swarming over a much larger insect. Once you heard the namesake gurgle of one, you knew the rest of the horde would be nearby.

The survivors outside did not have long before the horde would overtake them. Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do for them. They just had to hope that the Gurglers didn’t take notice of their hiding spot.

Or so Ulrin thought. As he learned from the squeaking of the chair being removed from the door, Cryaliss had other plans.

“What are you doing!?” he demanded.

“We can’t leave them out there,” she said as she pulled the door open.

“They’re already dead!” Ulrin insisted. “Forget the horde of Corrupted chasing them. They’ve been in the Blood Rain!”

She was already heading out the door, heedless of his warning. “There may still be a chance for them if I can get them inside and dry before the rain has had a chance to seep into their skin. I have to try!”

The door slammed shut behind her, ending any further debate.

Ulrin was left alone, dumbfounded, angry. And incredibly heartbroken.

Cryaliss claimed to be immune to the Blood Rain, but what could she hope to do against such a massive horde of Gurglers? She didn’t even have a weapon! And all to save some strangers?

He wanted to run after her, but it would be suicide. His cloak provided some protection from the rain, but not against a storm like this. He wouldn’t make it two steps outside before he was doomed.

“Damn it!” He slammed his hand against the window, frustration overflowing at his certainty that he had just lost his companion due to her impulsiveness. Another reason not to get attached.

It was impossible to follow along with what was going on outside through the storm. Cryaliss had disappeared from sight practically the moment she stepped out the door, and the glimpses of the lantern light came and went with the wind. Finally, he was unable to see anything at all.

Everything seemed to be over. The survivors that had led Cryaliss to her demise were also dead. And Ulrin was again alone.

Well, he was used to being alone. That was how he had survived these past five years. For some reason, it stung more this time.

He was getting ready to re-secure the front door when he heard a slam against it. Fearing that the Gurglers had found his location, he held Silverlight in front of himself and started to back away toward the hallway. He wished they had found a hiding place with a back door. Not that he could escape with the rain still falling.

The door burst open, revealing three cloaked figures carrying extinguished lanterns. They rushed inside and shut the door behind them.

“What in the hell?” Ulrin exclaimed.

The lead figure stopped, his eyes catching the point of Ulrin’s blade, and his hands went up defensively. “Woah, hey, we don’t want any trouble. We were told to come hide in here by some lady outside.”

“She led the Corrupted away,” the survivor said, his hands still raised. “Strangest thing. It’s like once she got out there, they were so focused on her that they didn’t even notice us anymore.”

Ulrin looked at the door. Cryaliss was still out there, and she was being pursued. But as long as it was raining, he couldn’t do anything for her. He’d just have to hope she knew what she was doing.

His attention went back to the three survivors. They wore heavy cloaks and wide-brimmed hats and had thick cloth draped over their faces. Their outfits were clearly chosen to give them some protection from the rain, and in lighter precipitation, it might have been enough. He doubted they had made it through such a heavy storm unscathed.

He remembered what Cryaliss had said before she left, that getting them dry before the rain had a chance to seep into their skin could save them. That was a rumor he had heard once before, with other survivors claiming to have experienced it themselves, though he had never witnessed it firsthand. Still, it was worth the effort to try.

“Get out of those clothes. Quickly and carefully! Put them over to the side there.” He rushed to his pack and removed some linens, which he then tossed to the rapidly stripping survivors. “Quickly, take these and dry yourselves down. Be thorough. Back, underarms, ass crack. Leave a single drop of that stuff on you, and you’re dead.”

He turned to give them a modicum of privacy, though he did give them a look over when they removed their outer layers to quickly size them up. They were young, maybe a year or two older than he was. The two men were thin but with frames that suggested formerly athletic builds, wasted away by malnutrition. The girl was small and scrawny, thin enough that he had not even been able to tell she was a woman before she had started undressing.

The students finished their frantic task, and Ulrin provided them with cleanish undergarments from his and Cryaliss’s packs. They were poor fits for the survivors, but better than forcing them to remain nude for the indefinite future.

“You think we got it?” the smaller of the two men asked his companion. “Were we fast enough?”

“I doubt it,” the other replied. “It was coming down pretty hard. I know I felt my face get sprayed in the wind a few times.”

“But we weren’t out there long,” the woman argued. “Even if it got on our skin, maybe it didn’t have time to seep in yet.”

The larger man shrugged. “We can hope. But also, be prepared for the worst. Any of us, or even all of us, could be Corrupted already and not even know it.” He turned his attention to Ulrin. “Not that I don’t appreciate you and that lady’s timely aid. We’d have been dead already. Thanks to you, we have a chance.”

Ulrin shook his head. “Thanks to Cryaliss. I didn’t do much.”

“Brave woman. She went out there without any protective covering.”

“She’s immune,” Ulrin said, looking again to the door in hopes that she would come through it. “So, the rain isn’t a problem for her. I’m more worried about the Corrupted.”

“Immune?”

The woman spoke up. “She’s a Blood Maiden, isn’t she? I thought I could make out her robes, but it was hard to tell for sure in the dark and rain.”

“Yes.”

The smaller man looked pale. “A Blood Maiden? Here? Why? Aren’t they the ones responsible for all this mess? Gods, as if dealing with the Corrupted isn’t enough. What if she comes to take our blood to use in her witchcraft?”

Ulrin was about to give the student a stern talking-to about his views on Blood Maidens, but his female companion beat him to it. “Don’t be rude. She went out there and risked her life to save us. Show some gratitude.”

The larger man nodded. “She’s right. We owe her too much to speak that way. Forgive my companion. We’ve spent quite a bit of time theorizing the causes of the end of the world, and we can get a little caught up in believing our own theories, even if there is proof otherwise. I also feel like I owe you a proper introduction. I’m Jeremiah. My loud-mouthed friend is Lucas. And this is Renni.”

“Maxwell,” Ulrin said. Based on Lucas’s reaction to Cryaliss being a Blood Maiden, it was probably prudent to keep his identity as prince secret for now. No reason to cause extra tension. “Tell me, Jeremiah, what were you doing out in the rain? Even with protective clothing, it’s not safe.”

“It wasn’t really our choice,” Jeremiah explained. “We had gone out to try to scavenge for food. The southern dorms seemed clear the last time we scouted, so we thought we might have a chance to dig around their kitchen for anything remaining. While we were out, we stumbled upon a single Gurgler and soon learned the southern dorms weren’t as empty as we’d thought. The bastards had all just been holed up in the rooms upstairs.”

“The Corrupted were hiding in the bedrooms?”

“Yeah. Like they still remembered which rooms belonged to them back when they were people. Strangest thing.”

Ulrin again remembered Gerevin’s speech about the minds of the Corrupted and felt a shiver.

“Anyway, we soon had what seemed like half the student body chasing us,” Jeremiah continued. “We made it back to our safe house before the rain started, but even with iron bands, the door wasn’t strong enough to withstand the pounding it took. We didn’t really have many options but to put on all the protective clothing we could find and make a dash through the rain to try to find another shelter. But we were having trouble shaking the Corrupted until your friend came to the rescue.”

“She has a habit of sticking her neck out for others,” Ulrin said. “Hopefully, it didn’t get her killed this time.”

“If it makes any difference, um . . . Maxwell, wasn’t it?” Renni said. “She seemed very fast. I think she could escape them.”

“She’s survived this long,” Ulrin agreed. “It has to mean something.” He wished he was as confident as he sounded.

“Nothing left for us to do anyway, but wait for the rain to stop,” he continued. “I don’t have much to offer in terms of comforts, but try to get some rest.”

The rain continued for a while. Ulrin did not sleep, instead sitting up and watching the door. The survivors attempted to rest for a while, but they were too stressed to sleep for more than a few minutes at a time. Ulrin couldn’t blame him. The pressure of waiting to see if you were infected or not must have been intense.

Finally, the rain began to let up. As the precipitation slowed to a drizzle, Ulrin prepared himself to set out to find Cryaliss.

Before he could, there was a knock on the door. He hurriedly rushed to open it and found Cryaliss waiting outside, soaked head to toe in red and clearly exhausted but seemingly unharmed.

“Sorry to keep you waiting,” she said. “I had to lure them far enough away that they wouldn’t follow me here.”

“That was really stupid, you know that?” Ulrin said. The giant smile on his face was at odds with his words.

“I know.”

“Well, get in here. There’re some people you’re going to want to meet.”

As the last of the crimson clouds parted from the sky, Cryaliss came back inside to greet the students she had risked her life to save.`,

      title: "Chapter 13",
      content: `Cryaliss’s legs ached from the exertion of her run, and her arms were sore from a rapid climb onto a rooftop she had to do to break free from the horde of Corrupted. But she didn’t want to show how tired she was. Not while there was still so much to do.

First, there was the matter of the rain-soaked clothes. She was the only one who could handle them without risk. She collected water from the river and carefully scrubbed and scraped the clothes until they were clean. Her robes also needed to be cleaned, though Ulrin got offended when she tried to remove them to clean them in the main room and insisted that she do it in one of the rooms in the back. She supposed he must have found her body unpleasant.

Then she needed to gather supplies. Though she was no longer hungry, she knew the others would need food and other items, and she wanted to take care of them before she rested. She and Ulrin did not have enough to split among three extra people, and she didn’t want to ask him to share his own supplies with strangers. After all, she was the one who had decided to take them in.

Unfortunately, on this second task, she was less successful. Her senses gave her the vague direction of Corrupted nearby, and though she could not locate them directly, she knew enough to realize that the dorms were still swarming with them. The few places she felt confident she could safely search had already been picked clean.

Ulrin surprised her by freely offering food from his own supplies without being asked to feed the students. She would have to make sure to repay him when she was able.

Finally, she wanted to sit down and talk to the survivors. The only way she would learn what they needed and how she could further aid them was to get to know them.

That was going to be made more difficult as shortly after she had returned their clothes to them, the one called Jeremiah announced they were going to leave.

“We should stick together,” Cryaliss pleaded. “Surviving is tough enough for any one person. If we stay together, we have a better chance.”

“We’ve already put you at enough of an imposition,” Jeremiah said. He was a serious-looking young man with long brown hair tied back behind his head. He had a tattoo on his neck. It looked like it was some sort of script, but she couldn’t read it. “Besides, there’s a good chance that the three of us are infected and, within a few hours, will be bloodthirsty beasts looking to tear you apart.”

“If that’s the case, would you rather turn out there?” Ulrin countered. “Join your fellow students in the horde? Wander aimlessly until another survivor turns up?”

Jeremiah shook his head. “What’s the other option?”

Ulrin’s face was stone. “Wait here with us. Stay until we know for sure whether or not you are infected. If enough time passes that you’re clear, then we can re-broach the topic of whether we should stay together or go our separate ways. And if you begin to show signs of Corruption . . .” He put his hand on the hilt of his sword, allowing that to finish his statement.

Cryaliss winced. She knew Ulrin was right, that it was the best way to handle things. Far better a merciful death than a tortured existence. But to say it so bluntly. She wished she had his gift for directness.

“It’s your call,” Cryaliss said. “We can’t force you to stay.”

Jeremiah looked at his companions to get their thoughts.

Renni shrank down, making herself even smaller than she already was. “I don’t want to become one of those things, Jeremiah.”

Lucas just nodded silently in agreement.

“Very well, we will stay,” Jeremiah said. “But you have to vow that when the time comes, you will be quick, and you will be thorough.”

“I promise,” Ulrin said solemnly.

Seeing the defeat in the three students’ eyes, Cryaliss rushed to restore some semblance of hope. “It’s still possible you aren’t Corrupted. Don’t give up on life just yet.”

“It’s important to be realistic about these kinds of things,” Jeremiah replied. “It’s okay. We’ve all known this day was coming for a long time. Whether it was from claws, or Corruption, or starvation, we’ve been living on borrowed time since The Bleeding. We survived many times our peers did not, but we knew our own time was limited. Every additional day we had was a gift, and nothing will take that from us.”

“Still fucking reeks, though,” Lucas added. He was a smaller man with big ears and a shock of blond hair. “To survive this long just to be taken out by the rain. Jeremiah’s right. We were lucky to make it this far, but I still wanted to make it further. And we finally find some new people to talk to after all this time, and one of the first things we have to discuss is the possibility of a mercy killing. What the fuck kind of luck is that?”

“The worst part for me is, what will be left when we are gone?” Renni asked. She was a pretty girl with auburn curls and a soft face, though it had become lined with stress and worry. “All of our friends are dead. Our families. Everyone who ever knew us, who ever cared about us, is either dead or has become one of those creatures. Once we pass it, it will be like we never existed at all.”

Her voice was filled with so much sorrow. Cryaliss’s heart broke for them. It was not enough that they had to wait for their possible end with nothing they could do to stop it, but they also faced an existential dread few would ever know.

Cryaliss did her best to keep her tone positive. “I can’t promise how long Maxwell and I will survive. Our path will take us directly into some of the most dangerous parts of the kingdom. But I can promise, if you wish to share your stories with us, to carry them with me for however much time I have left.”

Renni gave a little nod. Tears formed in her eyes, and she began to sob. Lucas stood up and went over to comfort her.

“I guess that’s a yes,” Jeremiah said. “Truthfully, I don’t see much point in it. Once you’re gone, you’re gone. But if Renni sees some comfort in it, then I’ll go along.”

“Do you want to go first?” Cryaliss asked.

“Might as well.” Jeremiah went over to the couch and sat down heavily. “Not sure what you want to know about me, though. I was only a second-year student when the end came. My life before wasn’t eventful, and my life since has been spent in hiding.”

Cryaliss sat down across from him. “How about the meaning of that tattoo? I’ve studied over a dozen scripts, and I’ve never seen anything like that. How did you get it?”

He rubbed at his neck like he had forgotten it was there. “It’s . . . well, I was going to say it’s a long story. But I guess that’s what you’re after, isn’t it?”

After a pause, he started. “I saw the script when I was just a kid. My family was very religious. The kind of religious that meant we spent as much time in the temples as we did at home. We took a trip to the mountains to look for herbs to make medicinal tea. The temple sent us out to help the families of those who couldn’t afford the medicine themselves. We took a lot of those trips, always with the pursuit of helping others, often at great expense to ourselves.”

“Your family lived their lives in service to others,” Cryaliss remarked. “It’s noble.”

“Noble intention, perhaps. But intent and reality tend to be unrelated.” Jeremiah’s voice was bitter. “When I got a little older, I learned the temples were turning a profit on all our ‘good deeds’ and the things we collected. While my family sacrificed so much that we often couldn’t keep a roof over our heads, the priests were building new mansions for themselves.”

Ulrin grunted. “Your local nobility let them get away with this? The temples are supposed to be public works and under their supervision.”

“No offense to whichever noble family you were a part of, Maxwell, but where I was from, the nobles did little other than collect taxes and sit on their asses,” Jeremiah answered.

“No offense taken. I, unfortunately, was familiar with a few noble families who behaved that way.”

“Please,” Cryaliss said, “continue your story.”

“We were walking down the mountain path, and I saw a cave. Right inside, I could see it was lined with these little blue crystal things that sparkled as the sunlight passed through. I thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I begged my parents to let me go inside, but they didn’t want to risk it. So, when they weren’t looking, I climbed onto a boulder and looked in from above. I leaned over real far to get a good look at those crystals. And I slipped and went head-first into the cave.”

He rubbed his head as he relived the memory. “Fortunately, at the bottom of the cave was a deep lake. By some miracle, I landed in it without cutting myself on any of the jutting crystals or rocks. I swam to the surface of the lake, and that was when I saw the script. It was carved into the wall between the crystals. I found it fascinating. Who had written it? What did it mean? Did it have anything to do with these strange crystals? I wanted to know more desperately than I ever wanted anything in my life before.”

“Did you find out?” Cryaliss asked.

“No. My parents were more concerned with scolding than listening to me, and no one I questioned after that had any idea. I ended up having to sneak back into the cave before we left to make a copy of the script so I wouldn’t forget it. I then dedicated myself to finding its meaning. I became a student of languages and writings in pursuit of my answers. It’s those studies that eventually led me to being accepted into the University.”

“Why get it tattooed on you, though?” Ulrin asked. “Especially if you don’t know what it means. For all you know, you marked yourself with an ancient dirty joke.”

Jeremiah rubbed at his neck. “My parents expected me to follow in their footsteps as a servant of the temples, and when they learned I wanted to become a scholar instead, they forbade it. They tried to trap me so I couldn’t attend the University. I needed an escape. The temples had a strict rule against desecrating your own body, which included forbidding tattoos. So, I secretly got one, which caused me to get expelled. My parents disowned me, but that left me free to pursue my passion. The tattoo represents both the secret which drives my path and my freedom to follow it.”

Cryaliss leaned toward him. “Thank you for sharing that story. It was very important. You were wrong to say you lived an uneventful life.”

He shrugged. “I fell into a cave and found some words. Words that I was never able to decipher. Maybe if I had gotten to finish my studies, I would have felt I had a story to tell. But unfortunately, I will never get my answers now.”

“You still might.”

“No.” He held up his hands. The tips had begun to tinge red, the faint pooling of blood toward the edges. The first steps toward the formation of claws. “I won’t.”

The change came for people at different speeds. For some, it was nearly instantaneous; for others, it could take as long as a day. But once the first physical signs appeared, it progressed rapidly. He did not have long.

“I’m sorry,” Cryaliss whispered.

“It is what it is,” he calmly replied. “Hey, Maxwell. I really don’t want to wait till I start resembling a burned marshmallow. Mind if we just get it over with?”

Ulrin nodded, and Jeremiah rose from the couch.

“Wait,” Cryaliss interrupted. “Before you go, would you mind if I made a copy of that script?”

He looked at her curiously. “Why?”

“Maybe I can find out what it means,” she explained. “I have certain perspectives as a Blood Maiden that might help. I know it might not mean much for the truth to be discovered after you’re already gone, but . . .”

Jeremiah, surprisingly, smiled. “I would like that. It’s actually comforting to think that the search for knowledge will outlive me.”

Cryaliss took some paper from her pack and carefully copied the script. Her training had taught her to copy all manner of foreign languages, including the highly complex Draconic script, so she was confident she had recreated it properly, but she showed her work to Jeremiah just to be sure.

“That’s it,” he said wistfully. “Strange to see it one last time like this. Do your best. If we meet again in the next life, I will want to hear your findings.”

Ulrin and Jeremiah stepped outside, away from the sight of Cryaliss and his fellow students. Only Ulrin returned.

“Hey, Renni,” Lucas said. “I know you were the one most concerned about the whole ‘being remembered’ thing, but do you mind if I go next? I think I might need to do it sooner rather than later.”

He wiped his hand across the bottom of his eye, and when he pulled it away, there was a steak of blood.

“Oh, no, Lucas,” Renni cried. “Not you too.”

“Sorry, you know me,” Lucas said. “Always following in Jeremiah’s footsteps. Should have figured I’d step after him right into his grave.”

Renni opened her mouth to say something, but nothing came out. She closed it and nodded at Lucas.

Cryaliss took a seat next to Lucas. “Tell me your story.”

He raised his hands in a flourish when he talked. “Well, I was raised by circus performers. Became a master of trapeze when I was just ten. Then my parents were killed in a tragic accident. Fortunately, I was then taken in by a reclusive noble.”

“Wow, really?”

Lucas sighed. “No. Not really. I just wanted something that sounded impressive after that show-off went first. How do you follow a story like that?”

“It doesn’t need to be impressive. It just needs to be about you. What mattered most to you in your life?”

He thought about it for a second. “I guess that would be my sister. I mean, she’s the whole reason I’m here. Well, here, as in the University. Not here, as in the middle of the apocalypse. She had nothing to do with that. I don’t think.”

“Tell me about her.”

Lucas grinned. “She was the best little sister a guy could ask for. Kind, goofy, energetic. She had this smile that was kind of lopsided when it got really wide. It was adorable. I would have done anything for her. And that includes traveling halfway across the kingdom to study under a bunch of stuffy old men in a place that’s apparently never heard of spicy food.”

Hearing Lucas describe his sister made Cryaliss feel warm. “How did going to the University relate to your sister?”

“She was born with an eye condition.” He wiped at his eye again. “Ironic, now, I think. Though hers wasn’t quite so deadly. It did slowly take her vision. She was mostly blind by the time I left home. There’s a treatment for it. Or there was. Supposedly wouldn’t just stop the progression but also reverse a lot of the damage. Give her sight back. But it was expensive. Sell-your-home level of expensive. There were only a few specialists in the world who could do it. So, I figured, if we can’t get the money, I’ll just become one of those specialists and do it myself.”

“Getting into the University is no easy feat,” Ulrin said. “Particularly for those seeking to study medicine. They get applications from all over. Your drive to help your sister must have been immense.”

“I worked my ass off, for sure,” Lucas agreed. “But also a bit of dumb luck. I just happened to meet one of the Professors of Medicine out at a bar one night. I’d been working there as a busboy to help pay for my studies. He got super drunk and got handsy with some women who were not his wife. Needless to say, he was willing to put in a good word for me in exchange for me keeping that to myself.”

Ulrin sighed. “First, the temple priests were corrupt; now, the University professors are getting blackmailed for admissions. I’m almost afraid of what else I’m going to learn about the pillars of the kingdom before this is through.”

“Sorry to break your nostalgic memory of the kingdom. But like I said, I’d do anything for my sister.” He bent over suddenly, clutching his head in his hand, his face contorted in pain. “Gah! Damn it. You couldn’t just give me creepy hands like Jeremiah. You got to go for my head. Fuck!” He turned to Ulrin. “I’d like to talk more about it, but I think it’s getting about that time.”

As the two walked toward the door, Cryaliss asked one more question. “What was your sister’s name?”

Lucas smiled despite the pain. “Lilian. What I wouldn’t give to have seen her one last time. And to have her see me. I hope, if there’s a next life, we are born as brother and sister again.”

They stepped outside. Ulrin returned a short time later. He was trying to hold his head high, but Cryaliss could see the cracks in his mask start to form. She hadn’t considered how hard this would be for him. It would have been easier for him to put down some strangers. But by forcing him to get to know them first, she was adding to that burden. Even when she managed to help one person, she ended up hurting another.

Renni sniffed and wiped away her tears. “I’m happy that Jeremiah and Lucas will be remembered. They were my friends.”

“Do you want to tell your story now?” Cryaliss asked.

“I don’t know if I would call it my story, but there is something I would like Maxwell to hear.”

Ulrin looked surprised. “Me?”

Renni walked over to stand in front of him. “I take it you don’t remember me. You wouldn’t. We only met for such a brief time, and you made a much bigger impression than I did. But I always remembered the day we met Prince Ulrin.”

“Oh, uhm . . . uh . . .” Ulrin fumbled. “I apologize for the deception. And for not recognizing you. Are you a noble’s daughter?”

“No. I was just a peasant girl. Only got into the University because I had a rare blood type. They’d provide me with an education in exchange for my providing samples for their studies. It was here that we met.”

Ulrin scratched at his chin. “I was only here once before.”

She smiled sadly. “Yes. You were taking a tour. I was part of the same tour group. I hadn’t been sure yet whether I wanted to attend the University. Growing up on a farm, I really wasn’t familiar with books, or math, or the sciences. I didn’t think I’d fit in. And then I saw you, at the head of the tour, being given all the attention from our guides. And you were so . . . so . . .”

“Charming?” Ulrin offered.

“Funny,” Renni corrected. “The guides would be lecturing you about the facilities and what is taught here, and you’d just nod along, and whenever they asked a question, you were completely clueless. Then they’d get mad at you, and you’d stand your ground like it was their fault you didn’t know the answers.”

Ulrin blushed. “I suppose I could have paid a bit more attention back then.”

“It didn’t seem to bother you at all that you didn’t know anything,” Renni continued. “And that made me really want to talk to you. So, right when the tour was about to end, I snuck my way to the front of the group to ask you a question. I asked you if you were scared to take classes here when you didn’t know as much as the other students. What you said changed my life. You said, ‘No, the professors are the ones who should be scared. They’re the ones who will be responsible for teaching me.’”

Cryaliss couldn’t help but laugh. That sounded like something Ulrin would say.

“So, I guess that inspired you to accept the University’s offer?” Ulrin asked.

“It completely erased all my fears of coming here,” Renni agreed. “But beyond that, I also really wanted to see you again. You were so funny but also handsome and, yes, charming. I was smitten. I knew you would be attending in a couple of years’ time, so I agreed to study here until then. You were a prince, so it probably would have been impossible for me to catch your attention, but I had my fantasies.”

Ulrin’s blush grew deeper. “I . . . You never know. I very rarely got on well with other nobles. I may have sought out a social circle without them. Maybe you would have been in it, and I would have noticed you, and . . .”

“And what?” Renni teased him. “Go on. I’d like to hear what you would have done.”

If Ulrin could get any redder, he’d be crimson. “I . . . uh . . . would have behaved appropriately for my station, I’m sure.”

“I’m sure you would have been a perfect gentleman,” Renni said with a chuckle. “Ah, even after the world turned red, I continued to have my fantasies, you know. Of my brave Prince Ulrin showing up one day, cutting through a horde of Corrupted to get to me, and whisking me off the safety. I can hardly believe you are actually here now. It feels unreal. Unfortunately, this is not quite how I imagined it. You came, but too late to take me away from here.”

She slowly held up her hands and revealed that her fingers, too, were taking on that tragic red hue. Renni, too, had been Corrupted.

Cryaliss’s heart dropped. Not one. Despite everything, not one could be saved.

“I’m so sorry,” Ulrin whispered. “I truly wish I could have lived up to your visions of me. But I’m no hero. I was hardly even a good prince.”

“Just you being here is more than I ever thought would happen,” Renni replied. “Knowing you survived, that you’re still fighting. I am content with that. Sad, scared, but content. Just promise me, this time, you won’t forget me.”

“I promise.”

They waited a bit, talking to each other, Renni getting to know about the real Prince Ulrin whom she had always admired, and Ulrin learning about her. But eventually, they could not wait any longer. Renni was getting woozy, and her body was burning. She was close to finishing her transformation.

Ulrin silently escorted her outside. A few minutes passed before he returned. He slumped down onto the couch and put his head in his hands.

Though Cryaliss was not sure how much good it would do, she sat down next to him and put her arm around him. He did not resist her.

They sat like that for a long while before exhaustion finally overtook them, and they fell into a deep slumber.

---

It hardly felt real, even as he watched the royal guard carry the ornate wooden casket onto the dais. As Ulrin glanced about at the gathering of royals, nobles, and Masters alongside him, he expected to see Omma beside them in her usual place. But she wasn’t there. And she never would be again.

How could things change so quickly? Just last week, his grandmother was still giving him lessons on history and insisting on serving him snacks and tea while he studied. There hadn’t been any signs of her health declining. Not physically, anyway. So why were they putting her to rest?

“Dry your tears, Ulrin.” The stern voice of his father spoke from his side. “It does not suit a member of the Emberlind family to be seen weeping. You are practically a man grown. You must not show weakness in front of the citizenry.”

Ulrin had hardly been paying any mind to the mass of commoners who had gathered below the platform, separated by the royals and nobility by a narrow staircase and a thick press of guardsmen. There were hundreds of them who came to pay their respects to the deceased royal. Though none of them knew her, had ever met her, or even seen her outside of public appearances. Their presence here seemed inappropriate, invasive. Ulrin did not want them here.

In a rare moment of blatant defiance against his father, he spoke back. “How can you be so cold? Do you not feel anything? Has the Drakenblud robbed you of all your emotions? We are at the funeral of Omma! If now is not the time for us to shed tears, then when?!”

It was fortunate that the ruckus from the crowds drowned out his speech. If anyone had overheard his chastisement of his father, surely the consequences would be severe. As is, he expected quite a bit of punishment once the ceremony was over. He didn’t care at that moment.

His father, surprisingly, did not immediately retort or scold him, but was quiet for a moment. “I understand better than you know. Omma will be missed deeply. But as wounded as we feel, we must nonetheless remain strong. It is our duty, our obligation to them.”

Ulrin looked at his father and saw something he, in his own grief, had missed before. There were cracks in the stern king’s façade. There was a sad glimmer in his eyes, a slight grimace in his mouth, and a barely perceptible tremble in his hands. From a distance, or even a passing glance in person, you would see nothing but the stone-faced and implacable King Emberlind. But, for the first time in his life, Ulrin could see past it. His father was grieving, even if he was trying not to show it.

Ulrin felt a pang of guilt in his chest. He had been so self-centered to think only of himself. Looking past the faces of his family and the gathered nobles who had all cared for and been touched by Omma in his life, he saw a lot of the same looks: stern externally, but clear grief underneath. And Ulrin had thought he was alone in his mourning. He was just the only one not doing his duty. And doing a disservice to Omma and everything she had worked for in her life by doing so. If she had still been alive, her next lesson to him would have been about the origins of the Emberlind decorum.

Turning back to the crowd, Ulrin made a concerted effort to straighten up and behave the proper prince. Everything he was taught about how to carry himself, express himself, and move came to him, and he allowed those lessons to guide him as opposed to his thoughts. Or his heart. Those were at odds now.

“Why does it matter?” This was neither the time nor the place, he knew, but he couldn’t help himself. “If they saw us being weak for a moment, in our grief? Would that really harm their opinions of us so deeply?”

Again, instead of a rebuke, he received a calm, perhaps even gentle, response. “Do you remember why it is that the Emberlinds take on the blood of the dragons? What grants us that right to control it, and who receives its gifts?”

Ulrin was confused. What did this have to do with what he asked? “It’s because of our ancestors. We are descended from those who slayed the dragons that enslaved us and claimed their blood as the new rulers.”

“That’s the effect without the cause. Our ancestors were capable of slaying the dragons because they were the strongest, the bravest, and, most importantly, those most willing to lay down their lives to protect others against impossible odds. It is because they proved themselves worthy as leaders and protectors that they were made the rulers of a new nation and entrusted with the Drakenblud. The Blud is a tool we wield in our duties, but we must prove ourselves worthy as rulers beyond the boons it grants. We are, first and foremost, protectors of the people, but even with our gifts, we are not invincible. But we must seem to be. The people must have faith that we will protect them from any threat. And so, we must not show any weakness, not give them even a single thread of fallibility for them to unwind, for if we do, we risk losing that faith, and thus losing our right to rule them.”

It was logical and allowed pieces of everything Ulrin had been taught about his family over the course of his life to fall into place and make a great deal more sense. But at the same time, it rang a bit hollow. If they wanted the people to believe they could protect them, wouldn’t actions speak louder than trivialities, like how they acted at a funeral?

Then again, there had been no major threats to the kingdom in quite a few generations, as far as Ulrin’s studies had told him. Perhaps in a world at peace, the only action you can take to prove your strength lies in the minutiae.

He nodded, letting his father know he understood, even though he still had his doubts. Either way, he did not intend to embarrass the family any further. His tears could come later, in private.

A brief speech was made to the crowd by the royal historian, summing up Omma’s titles and her biggest accomplishments over the course of her life. It felt strange to Ulrin that someone with as much personality and who had lived as long as his grandmother could have her entire life summed up in just a brief few minutes. It made him wonder how long the speech for his own death would be. A morbid thought.

When the historian was done, a fire was lit just below the platform in front of the crowds. The king stepped up to the casket. Though it had taken six men to haul the heavy casket up onto the dais, King Emberlind, bolstered by the strength of the Blud inside, was able to lift it with little outward effort. Alone, he carried the casket down the narrow staircase, and once he reached the bottom, he gently laid it into the fire. Then he kneeled and watched as the flames took Omma from this world.

Ulrin was so absorbed watching from his position back on the platform that he didn’t notice his brother coming to take his father’s spot beside him.

“You are right to ask questions.” Gerevin’s voice came as a surprise to him. “Though I doubt you will find the answers satisfactory. Nor will they cause the hypocrites of our family to reconsider their stances.”

“What are you talking about?” Ulrin whispered. Even with the roar of the crowd, Ulrin was worried someone would overhear.

Gerevin had made a rare appearance outside of his lab to attend the funeral. He was dressed and groomed proper as the prince and heir was expected to be, but dark circles under his eyes told of his late nights. “Your conversation with our father. I was just agreeing with you. The king’s view of the portrayal of power is petty and shortsighted.”

Ulrin was shocked to hear his brother say such things and nearly lost his composure before catching himself. “I never said that!” he whispered forcefully.

“Were you not thinking it?” Gerevin’s gaze drifted over the crowd. “They don’t care if we cry, or yell, or do a little happy dance. In their minds, our power comes from one place: the Drakenblud. It may be true that our ancestors had once earned the right to rule through action, but since then, the stolen strength of the Drakenblud has kept us in power. It’s hard to stage a rebellion when each member of the royal family is worth a hundred soldiers in battle. After all, if this was not the case, why would we keep relying on it this long past it being a necessity?”

Ulrin found himself getting angry with his brother. It was one thing to question decorum; it was another entirely to speak so ill of their family. And from Gerevin, of all people. He was the last person he’d expected to hear it from.

Gerevin must have noticed the anger on his face because he quickly changed his tone. “I apologize, brother. I, too, am processing my grief at Omma’s passing, and I’m afraid it’s made my thoughts quite morbid. It is hard to hear such talk about power when faced with that which we are powerless to change.”

With a sigh of relief, Ulrin nodded in agreement. He understood. When he had first heard the news of Omma’s passing, he too had lashed out in anger, taking it out on poor servants who had done nothing to deserve it until the rage had turned to sorrow and guilt for his actions. He could hardly blame Gerevin for acting similarly. All of them were grieving in their own way.

He turned his attention back to the flames as the last remnants of his beloved grandmother turned to ash and drifted into the sky.`,

      title: "Chapter 14",
      content: `They prepared for what promised to be a lengthy search for the controls to get the gates open. To the best of Ulrin’s memory, they’d be in a secured area away from public spaces, so that excluded the dorms. It also had to be somewhere close enough to the man-made river for the mechanisms to reach. That narrowed their search area somewhat, but it could still be days before they found what they were looking for. He expected they would have to comb through many old buildings, moving carefully so as to avoid the attention of the Corrupted and being conservative with their supplies.

What he was not expecting was for an opening in the front gate to have been made for them.

It definitely had not been there when they had first arrived. There was no way he wouldn’t have noticed it. Two or three of the steel wires that made up the dome around the University had been removed somehow, forming a gap wide enough for a person. A rope ladder had been set down from the gap that ended about five feet from the ground. Ulrin could see an equivalent ladder on the opposite side of the dome.

“Well, that’s . . . convenient,” Ulrin said. “Perhaps too convenient? What are the odds that an opening would be made right as we were trying to get in?”

“Maybe someone on the inside was looking to help the students trapped in the dorms?” Cryaliss suggested.

“But why now? Jeremiah’s group had been surviving out here for five years, and they were certainly not the only ones.”

Cryaliss looked up at the gap. “Renni recognized you. Maybe someone on the campus saw you and wants to help you because you are a prince.”

He frowned. “A lot of the people I’ve met who have recognized me haven’t exactly been friendly about it.”

“Then what else could it be?”

“I don’t know. But we should be alert.”

“We’re going to use it, though?” Cryaliss asked.

He nodded. “Beats ducking Corrupted for the next few days while we look for controls that may or may not still work. It’s a risk we have to take.”

They secured their packs and began to climb. Ulrin went over first, going carefully through the opening and slowly descending to the campus grounds. He tried to control his breathing to not interfere with his ability to listen for dangers, but the rope was challenging. Particularly since the dome itself provided little in terms of places he could safely put his weight on, and he had to pull himself entirely with his upper body strength. Descending was easier than climbing, but he still had to try to go down slowly. He did not want to land with too much of an impact that might attract attention.

He finally neared the end. Above him, Cryaliss was just passing through the opening. He was worried she might not have had the strength for such a feat, and he would have to find a way to assist her, but she had impressed him.

The rope came to an end with his feet still dangling about six inches from the floor. He let go while positioning himself to land on the balls of his feet, hopefully quieting his landing.

It made no difference. The moment his feet hit the ground, the dirt sank down as some mechanism underneath was pressed under his weight. Gears turned, and a moment later, the sound of bells rang out. Loud and nearby, certain to draw every creature on the campus right to him.

“Go back, Cryaliss!” he called out. “This is a trap! We have to go! Now!”

She did not get a chance to respond, as the same mechanism that rang the bell severed the rope to prevent any escape. Unfortunately, Cryaliss was still halfway up it. She let out a yelp as she fell.

Ulrin rushed beneath her and outstretched his arms, catching her right before she could hit the hard ground.

The rope coiled uselessly beside them.

“Guess we’re not getting back out that way,” Ulrin said as he set Cryaliss on her feet.

Her attention immediately became fixed on the campus in front of them. “They’re coming. A lot of them.”

True to her word, the sounds of howls, wails, and twisted cries quickly filled the air. Dozens. Hundreds. All coming straight toward them.

Ulrin swore an oath of revenge against whoever set this trap for them while he quickly took in their surroundings. The gate was immediately behind them, sealed shut. In front of them, a wide avenue stretched between two long, rectangular buildings, each marked with the numbers of the various classrooms within. They both seemed like they had been through a fire, one that had spread through the street by the looks of the char marks on the road. They were blackened inside and out, and their roofs had fallen in. There would be no safety in there.

To their left, down a narrow path from the gate, a large building stood at least three stories tall and had been spared the worst of the disasters that had struck this part of the campus. The main administration building, Ulrin remembered. It housed several secured areas, including the main gate controls. If they could get in there, it might provide a barrier between them and the horde coming their way.

“Over there,” he said, taking his first strides down the path.

Cryaliss grabbed him, stopping him from going any further. “Not there. I can sense something, something terrifying in that building.”

“More terrifying than the horde that will be on us any second?” he asked.

“Yes. The only other thing I’ve ever felt that even came close to this was your brother.”

As loath as he was to admit it, he did not wish to face another creature like Gerevin. His brother could have killed him without so much as breaking a sweat.

That just left the street running to their right, which wound along the outskirts of the campus, sticking close to the dome, before making its way into an open park-like area. It would leave them out in the open, but at least there wouldn’t be anything to slow them as they made their way deeper into the campus.

They set off running just as the first of the Corrupted popped into view. It was a tall, lanky creature with skin the color of ash. It had a head that resembled that of a wolf, with a snout, fur, and fangs, and the body of a man. It walked upright, though it was bent at the waist, giving it a hunched-over appearance. It was not a creature Ulrin had encountered before, and he had not yet put a name to it, but it was terrifying.

It sprinted toward them at an inhuman pace, quickly closing the distance between them as they tried to reach the park. It’d be on them long before they reached it. Ulrin was left with no choice but to face it. He turned on his heels, drawing Silverlight in one fluid motion, and prepared to combat the wolfish Corrupted.

“Don’t let it get in close,” Cryaliss warned. “The fangs on that thing can crush steel. If it locks its jaws on you, it’s over.”

Ulrin could tell she was afraid of it from the warble in her voice. He didn’t blame her. “Keep going. I’ll be right behind you!”

“We stick together,” she argued.

He didn’t have time to insist as the Corrupted reached them. It opened its jaws wide and lunged at Ulrin. He jumped back, avoiding the attack, and brought his sword up at an angle for the creature’s throat. It ducked to the side, letting the blade go past it.

Self-preservation instincts were rare among the Corrupted, but those that did possess them were the most dangerous of foes. You couldn’t really hope to match one in strength or speed, and your best bet was to stick them while they were vulnerable during an attack. Take that opportunity away, and things could go very badly very quickly.

Ulrin tried to press the attack, flowing into an aggressive stance that led to one strike after another in rapid succession, but nothing connected. The creature’s reflexes were absurd, and it could twist its body in ways that would kill a normal man to avoid the blade.

It suddenly dropped to all fours as a strike went over its head. With a snarl, it tried to get its jaws around Ulrin’s leg. Instead of retreating, Ulrin brought his foot forward in a kick. It struck the creature on the top of the snout, eliciting a cry of pain that sounded like a dog’s whimper. Ulrin tried to bring his sword down on it while it was dazed, but it rolled out of the way.

The creature was quickly back on its feet and coming for him again. Ulrin found himself out of position after his last attack and unable to react in time. He waited for the piercing pain of the creature’s jaws finding his flesh . . .

The creature stopped just inches from him. It turned to look at Cryaliss, who was holding her hand out toward it, a look of concentration on her face.

The wolf-like creature coiled itself as it prepared to lunge toward Cryaliss, but as it did, it left its back wide open to Ulrin, who was not about to miss this opportunity. He jabbed Silverlight through the back of the creature’s neck, its magic allowing it to pierce easily through its tough hide. It let out half a gurgled yelp before collapsing to the ground.

Ulrin looked over at Cryaliss, many questions coming to his mind as to what she had just done. He remembered Jeremiah saying that she had somehow lured all the Gurglers after her, how those creatures had seemed to ignore everyone but her as soon as she appeared. Did she have some kind of Blood Maiden power to draw the Corrupted’s attention? And if so, did that mean the connection between the Corrupted and the Blood Maidens was closer than he’d thought?

There wasn’t any time to get answers, though, as the rest of the Corrupted were already upon them. In the time it had taken them to dispatch the wolf creature, a horde of monsters had poured down the burned road and now filled the path behind them. A veritable army of fangs, claws, spikes, spines, and twisted appendages meant only for killing bore down on them like something out of their worst nightmares.

“We need to keep moving!” Cryaliss shouted as she grabbed him by the arm and pulled him into motion, breaking him from his stupor at the sight of the horde.

At least one of them was keeping a level head, he thought, as they sprinted full speed into the park.

Ulrin had faced rough odds before. He had even been in situations where he was sure he was going to die. But he had never seen a horde of Corrupted anywhere near that size. More than just fear, the horde brought to mind his great existential crisis. Every one of those creatures had once been a person with hopes, dreams, and a life. The size of the horde was a stark and upsetting reminder of just how many people The Bleeding had claimed.

They reached the park, where the path split in three directions, going into different parts of the University. They didn’t have time to analyze their choices, so they picked the one that had the shortest distance to a building. Their only chance was to find a place they could get lost in.

He didn’t make it far down their chosen path before something ripped him off his feet and sent him vaulting backward. It was a Reacher, a Corrupted with a long arm covered in sticky, viscous fluid, like a paste. The arm could stretch like rubber, and Ulrin had been caught on the back of his waist.

Ulrin dug his feet into the ground to slow his velocity. He cut his sword behind him, and despite the awkward angle that kept him from getting any real leverage, Silverlight easily cut through the Reacher’s arm. It let out a cry and retracted the remainder of its arm, leaving its hand stuck to the back of Ulrin’s cloak. He’d have to find a way to remove its adhesive later.

He was in the thick of things now. Before he got himself free, he had been dragged back to within spitting range of the horde. He broke into a sprint, angling himself across the park toward a small alcove where a covering had been set up to give the students a break from the sun. He leaped up, grabbing the top of the covering and pulling himself up just as a Crawler’s claw cut through where he had just been.

The Corrupted were right behind him, jumping and climbing and stumbling over each other to get up to the covering. The small structure, not designed to support much more weight than its own, began to buckle. Ulrin ran to the other end and leaped off just as it cracked and collapsed under the weight of the horde. He aimed for an old lantern post and jumped with just enough momentum to grab onto it with his outstretched hand. This, too, some came under the assault of his pursuers as they scrambled up it to reach him.

He pulled himself up onto a precarious perch atop the post, just barely wide enough for the heels of his feet, and crouched down so that he could thrust his sword below him. The first creature to make it up the post was one of the Blind, climbing hand over hand with frantic speed while that strange clicking sound emanated from his mouth. It caught his blade through its overgrown ear, and it screamed as it fell down upon the rest of the horde. Next was a creature that looked like a man who had fallen into a thorn bush at first glance. Its flesh split open at the shoulders and torso to sprout long, spike-laden vines that wrapped around its body. The spikes dripped a liquid that sizzled when it landed on the creatures following below. Ulrin angled his blade to cut along an exposed area on the creature’s back to avoid the thorns. It, too, fell from the post onto the scrambling horde.

There was a jolt as the base of the post started to crack from the assault of the horde of creatures. This is what Ulrin had been expecting. Now came the hard part: trying to angle the fall in the right direction.

Oh, and trying to survive the fall without cracking his head open, as well. Also important.

He positioned his weight to try to direct the post as it tipped. It started slowly, as the last of the base gave way, but then all at once, it fell, and Ulrin nearly slid off it. He just barely wrapped a leg behind it, allowing him to ride it as it crashed down into the side of the steel dome.

Ulrin was sent flying forward and impacted the metal with more force than he expected. The strands of twisted steel dug into his arms and shoulder, and the sudden pain caused him to drop his sword. He nearly dropped himself, barely managing to get his hands around one of the bars before falling backward.

“Well, now what?” he muttered as he looked down at the horde gathering just below him. He hadn’t really thought further ahead than, “I need to get off the ground to avoid being overrun.” Now he was stuck holding on to a steel bar for his life, with no sword and nowhere to go. Already, his arms burned with the effort of holding himself up. He tried to find footholds to support himself, but the bars below him twisted at another angle. The dome wasn’t designed to be climbed like this. If anything, Ulrin thought he remembered that the design of the dome was specifically looking to prevent climbing.

His only saving grace was that difficulty slowed the Corrupted as well. A chaotic scene unfolded below him as dozens of the monsters attempted to rapidly climb up the steel bars to reach him, only to fall when the design twisted at an awkward angle and landed back in the milling pile of flesh below.

Maybe they’ll get bored and go away? It was a nice thought.

One that was put to rest when the Crawlers got to the front. They dug their spider-like legs into the sides of the bars, the spikes at the end digging into the steel. One leg after another, slowly going from one bar to the next, they ascended. There truly wasn’t anything they couldn’t climb.

“That’s less than ideal.”

Ulrin pulled himself to the side, slowly shimmying his way across the bars, trying to find an angle that would take him down toward the ground and away from the Crawlers. But he was not nearly fast enough.

Just as he was debating whether he’d rather be killed by the Crawlers’ spikes or by a fall to the ground, everything suddenly stopped. He looked back and saw Cryaliss standing in the middle of the park, her arms raised. The creatures turned their attention from Ulrin to the Blood Maiden.

“I’ll draw as many of them away as I can!” she shouted up to him. “Find what you came here for!”

And she took off running, the bulk of the horde following in hot pursuit.

“Damn it!” He had hoped she had been using the time he had bought jumping around to get away. This didn’t work if they both were the ones looking to make the sacrifice.

Most of the Crawlers followed the horde, leaping from the bars to the ground to pursue Cryaliss. But one of them remained. As soon as Cryaliss was out of sight, it turned its attention back toward Ulrin and resumed climbing.

“Oh, would you piss off?”

He let go of the bar and dropped down toward the Crawler, extending his leg as he fell. His foot was planted into the face of the Crawler with the full force of his weight. There was a crack as he broke the bones in the creature’s face. It twisted backward and fell from the bars.

Ulrin couldn’t climb down the dome, so he proceeded to do what he would call “controlled falling.” He dropped, reaching out to get a hand on whatever bars he could to slow his descent to a survivable pace. He bumped and scraped against it, and on one misplaced grab, he felt like his shoulder had nearly been pulled out of its socket, but he managed to hit the ground fairly softly. Well, soft enough that he didn’t break a leg, anyway.

The bulk of the horde had followed Cryaliss, but a fair number of the Corrupted had lingered about, and they turned their attention back on Ulrin the moment he landed. He ran, grabbing Silverlight from the ground as he went, and took off for the other end of the park.

He turned down onto the main avenue of the campus. There was no sign of which way Cryaliss had gone. She had survived this kind of thing once before; he had to trust she would do so again. Right now, he had to survive himself.

Ulrin ducked between buildings, taking sudden turns down into alleys, ran down back paths, and leaped low barriers, all in hopes of losing, or at least slowing down, his pursuers. But no matter how much he tried, he couldn’t shake them. He might get them out of sight for a minute or mislead them and send them running in the wrong direction, but if he ever thought he might be able to slow down and catch his breath, he’d be quickly spotted again by a creature whose cries would alert the others. The University was filled with them, and there didn’t seem to be any escape.

His legs burned, and it was getting harder to breathe. The exertion was getting to him. He could not keep this up forever, or he’d be too weak to put up a defense when he was caught. If losing them was out of the question, the best he could do was try to pick the battlefield that would give him the best odds.

Not far from him was the University commons. Here stood a roundabout that featured a number of the University’s most prestigious facilities, including its grand library, high-end Observatory, and top-of-the-line medical research facility. A network of elevated walkways connected the buildings, linking areas on the upper floors to one another. The result was a grid-like pattern of footbridges that rose over the roundabout.

The closest of these buildings was the library. Ulrin made a dash for its front door. The door seemed pretty solid. If he could get inside and seal it up, it might buy him enough time to set up a defensible last-stand position.

As he approached, a man appeared. A thickset fellow with heavy spectacles and a thinning hairline. The man stepped off one of the walkways and reached the door just before Ulrin did. He ran inside and began to shut the door.

“Wait!” Ulrin shouted, thinking the man hadn’t seen him. “Don’t close the door yet!”

The man looked his way, fixing Ulrin with a passive expression.

Then he shut the door.

Ulrin slammed up against the door, but it was already locked. He pounded against it, to no avail.

“Fucker!”

The direction back across the roundabout he had taken was now filled with Corrupted. At least two dozen of them in all shapes and sizes, hungry for his blood. And blocking any chance of reaching the other buildings.

He climbed onto the walkway the balding asshole had come down and made his way up a series of stairs until he was on the highest catwalk, about five stories from the ground. Panting, he finally stopped and turned to face his pursuers.

This was as good a spot as he was likely to get. If he ran in through the door to the connecting building, he might find himself cornered or run into more Corrupted inside and become surrounded. While this wasn’t an ideal spot, he could do worse. The walkway was narrow; no more than one creature would be able to come at him at a time. It was too high up for them to jump up, and there wasn’t anything for them to climb. They would have to come at him from the direction he came. Well, unless he got unlucky and more poured out from the door behind him. But if that was the case, he would be dead anyway.

He’d have liked to be in a spot with a few fortifications. Some barriers to slow the approach of the enemy, some traps to catch and disable a few, and maybe, if he was lucky, even a quick path of retreat. But life was rarely ideal. He would take what he could get.

The creatures swarmed up onto the walkway. First up was a Dancer, a name Ulrin had given the Corrupted because it walked in a strange spinning motion. Its arms had been morphed into long blades, and it held them out straight when pursuing its prey, spinning more and more rapidly as it approached. It reminded him of a tool he had seen the castle kitchen staff use to cut up vegetables and spices.

Using a typical sword, Dancers were one of the more challenging enemies. Their reach was great, and those blades were as sharp and strong as even a master-crafted longsword. They spun so fast that it was hard to find a vulnerable opening, and attempting to thrust at the wrong time could lead to the loss of your hand.

But Ulrin had come to have faith that Silverlight was not bound by the rules of a normal sword. It had no trouble with the spikes of the Crawlers or the hides of the Blind. He trusted the blades of the Dancer would be no exception.

He’d still only get one shot, as the Dancer had him beat on reach. The moment it got within range, he took a single step forward and unleashed a downward slash with Silverlight. The sword caught and severed the first of the blades and then the second as the creature’s spin brought it around. Ulrin cut off the creature’s anguished cry by following through with an upward slash, slicing the creature across its middle. It fell over the side of the walkway in a spray of blood.

Just a step behind was a Crawler. From its broken face, Ulrin could tell this was the one he had kicked off the side of the dome. And it seemed pretty pissed about it. It lunged at him, shrieking at the top of its lungs. Ulrin parried two strikes from the creature’s spiked hooks before performing a thrust between them, putting the point of Silverlight through the Crawler’s eye and into its brain. He quickly retracted the blade and let the body fall away.

One after another, they came. Claws and blades and fangs sought his throat, and Ulrin had to trust his reflexes and the power of Silverlight to end them before they could end him. Three . . . five . . . nine . . . eleven Corrupted met their demise at the end of his blade. The pathway before him was slick with their blood, as were his gloves, though Silverlight remained as pristine as always.

This was working as well as he could have hoped. But he was growing tired. Well, he was already tired from all the running and climbing, but now he neared total exhaustion. Maintaining his sword forms, performing strike after strike, barely turning aside lethal blows from his body, it rapidly wore him down. His arms burned, his chest felt like it was on fire, and sweat poured down his forehead and threatened to blind him by getting into his eyes. Only sheer adrenaline kept him focused and upright.

He just needed to keep it up a while longer. There had to be an end to them. Even if there didn’t seem to be. Even if he could still hear the clamoring of bodies as even more rushed up the pathway to meet him. There had to be an end.

One of the Blind rushed toward him. As he readied his sword for another strike, there was a loud crash behind him, and the walkways shook violently, nearly knocking him off his feet. He glanced behind him and saw an unfamiliar creature had landed behind him. Some monstrous cross between man and toad, with legs so inflated they would be humorous in any other situation.

So much for the hope that the creatures couldn’t get behind them. Who would have guessed there was one that could jump like that?

The creature leaped back in the air, and Ulrin could see those gigantic legs coming right for him as it came down. He had seen the impact they had on the walkway and did not want to see what would happen if they landed on him. He dove, barely ducking under the outstretched arms of the Blind as he went past. The creature came down, landing atop the Blind and crushing its body into a mess of shattered bones and fleshy pulp. The walkway shook again under the impact . . .

There was a snap as the supports that held the walkway to the building broke free. The entire structure swung loose, and Ulrin lost his balance and stumbled over the side. He grabbed a guide rail with one hand and clung to it as the wildly swinging catwalk swung back in the other direction. It crashed into the side of the building with a resounding impact, which caused the remaining support to break. As hundreds of pounds of wood, stonework, and steel came crashing down, Ulrin pushed himself as hard as he could away from it, hoping to avoid being crushed and buried.

He hit one of the lower walkways on his left leg. It buckled from the jolt of the impact, and he went down hard with the rest of his momentum. His shoulder took the brunt of the force, but his head still took a hard hit as he fell onto his back.

Ulrin’s vision blurred, and his mind became muddled. Between dizziness and exhaustion, his body just wanted to give up. Lie there and just let whatever would happen happen.

He was snapped back into reality as a piece of the metal railing from the fallen walkway hit the ground next to his face. Just a few inches to the left, and it would have gone through his head.

Everything hurt, but he forced himself up to his knees and narrowed his eyes to clear his vision. He was hit with a wave of nausea, but he pushed it down. Now would not be a good time to vomit. Not that there ever was one.

He looked up at the direction he had fallen from to look for more falling debris—and saw the toad-like Corrupted jumping down toward him!

Ulrin jumped quickly to his feet, ignoring the pain in his knee and ankle, and brought his sword up in a diagonal slice in the same motion. Silverlight cleaved through the creature’s engorged legs just before it could land. The legs thudded heavily to the ground, and the Corrupted’s upped body flipped end-over-end over the side of the walkway. Its screams could be heard as it dropped, followed by a hard contact with the ground.

Scanning the area quickly, Ulrin realized the chaos of the falling walkway had granted him a temporary reprieve from the rest of his pursuers. Some had fallen to their deaths during the collapse; others were now struggling along the adjacent catwalks, unable to figure out the immediate path to where Ulrin had landed. If he could get out of sight now, he might be able to lose them for good.

He limped over to the end of the walkway and toward the closest door. His ankle shot needles of pain all the way up his leg with every step. It was probably twisted. Hopefully, just twisted and not broken. His knee didn’t feel like it was in much better shape. And that said nothing about the damage to his head and shoulder. Hopefully, he would get a chance to take stock of his injuries soon. But first, escape.

As he reached the door, he said a little prayer that it be unlocked.

It opened, and Ulrin stepped inside, quickly shutting and locking the door behind him. A desk nearby made for a decent enough barricade. Jamming it up against the door under the handle should keep the door from being easily broken open. Not that it would hold against an entire horde, but it was something.

Now to figure out exactly where he was.

Well, maybe after a quick break. Ulrin struggled as far away from the door as he could, hoping to make it less likely the creatures would notice he was in here until his body finally couldn’t take anymore and dropped to the ground.

“Just a quick break,” he mumbled to no one as his vision clouded again. “Just a quick . . . once I catch my breath, I’ll be . . .”

Silence.`,

      title: "Chapter 15",
      content: `When he once struck his head falling down a flight of stairs in the castle, Ulrin’s mother had been adamant that he shouldn’t sleep with a concussion. Despite how tired he was, she had made him stay awake, repeating minor pieces of trivia until she was certain the danger had passed. The experience had left an impression on the young Ulrin, and he had always kept this factoid about head injuries in the back of his mind.

So, when he woke up shortly after his fall, he was quite startled, to say the least. He was quite upset that he had allowed himself to pass out like that. As if this world didn’t present enough dangers to those who slept in unsecured places, to fall asleep after hitting his head was foolish. Not that he really could have helped it. His body had just given out.

He had no idea whether he had been out for just a few minutes or if it had been considerably longer. However long it was, it wasn’t enough for the injuries he had sustained to cease their aching. Speaking of which, it was about time he checked just how bad they were. Another reason it had been foolish passing out like that. Leaving those injuries untreated for so long might lead to them being far worse than they could have been.

There was a torch sconce on a nearby wall, and Ulrin lit it after making sure he was far enough from the door and any windows to keep the light from being seen outside. In the light of the torch, he began to examine his body. As he had thought, his ankle had been twisted; though fortunately, it did not seem to be broken. His knee and lower leg were badly scraped up, and it hurt to bend, but everything seemed to still be in the right place. His shoulder was badly bruised and made an unpleasant popping noise when he lifted his arm above his head. That was troubling, but again, nothing seemed to be completely broken.

Examining his head injury was going to be more difficult. He’d have to find some kind of mirror. Time to look around.

Raising the torch on his uninjured side, he took in the room he now found himself in. It was an oval chamber with a spiraling staircase around the outside, with rows of instruments, bookshelves, and desks spread out across the various landings along the stairway. The staircase eventually led up to a platform where a massive cylinder jutted out of the arched ceiling.

The Observatory. Once the heart of the Kingdom of Lorn’s efforts to study the stars and the places far beyond.

Fortunately, it wasn’t too hard to find a reflective surface among the piles of instruments laid out on a table nearby. He got a look at himself and was shocked. It appeared he was in rougher shape than he had thought. At some point during the fall or the impact, he must have bitten his tongue as dried blood ran down his mouth and chin. But that was nothing compared to the matted blood around the back of his head. On the left side of the top of his head, there was a pretty bad laceration where quite a bit of his blood had poured out. It seemed to be clotted up for the moment. At the very least, all the blood seemed to be dried and not fresh. But it was still pretty bad. He’d have to have Cryaliss take a look at it.

If he ever saw her again, that is. He had no idea how long he had been unconscious, but it was likely over an hour, given that his blood was clotting. He had no way of knowing if she was even still alive at this point. He wanted to believe she was. But if she was, where would she have gone? Was she looking for him? Or would she have been trying to find a way to escape from the campus?

He needed to get out of there if he was going to have any hope of finding her. After quickly doing what he could for his injuries with the little supplies he had on hand, mostly cleaning and covering them, he made for the door.

Ulrin stopped himself before getting close, an instinct telling him to approach the door carefully. He crept to the side of the door and peered out through the window.

It seemed his pursuers had never given up on finding him. Like loyal dogs searching feverishly for their master. Only instead of it being due to love and affection, it was the desire to tear him apart.

They were gathered all along the walkways and the grounds beside. It didn’t look like they knew exactly where he was. At least, not yet. One got close and gave the door a slight tap, making Ulrin’s heart jump. But when the door didn’t open for it, it simply ambled off. For now, as long as the door remained sealed, he was safe.

Though he was also trapped. As far as he could tell, examining the path the spiraling staircase took, there were other ways in and out. If he remembered correctly, there were classrooms directly below on the lower floors, but there didn’t seem to be an internal door between the two sections of the building.

“I knew one day I’d be trapped in this damn University,” he grumbled. “Didn’t expect it to be like this.”

Hoping to find something he’d missed, he set out to more thoroughly explore the Observatory.

The first thing he noticed was that the bookcases lining the walls were filled with books he had never seen before. There was a lot of stuff on astronomy and astrology, but with a smattering of books on mathematics and theology. Back in the royal castle, the library was kept stocked with books that were of immediate interest to the royal family and the Masters who resided there, as well as books on the genealogy of the nobility. When Gerevin returned from his study at the University, books on chemistry and biology had been brought in. Ulrin had never seen anything on space, though.

It was a topic that could have interested him. Potentially. At least, if anything science-related could have held his attention for a minute, it probably would have been astronomy. Unfortunately, that pursuit had been soiled for him pretty early.

The Master of Students, a stuffy shirt named Jeffries, had brought him and the rest of the prospective students to the Observatory as part of the tour. The head of the astronomy department, an older man named Gallian, introduced them to the facility. He spoke with great pride about the facility, and for once, Ulrin had been paying attention.

“Our Observatory here is the most advanced in the known world,” Gallian said proudly. “Including possessing the most advanced telescope for studying the stars. Like standard telescopes, we use lenses for focusing the light from distant planets so we can see them more clearly. What sets ours apart is that we have a mystical clarifying lens forged from a dragon’s eye. It gives us the ability to see much further and with much deeper clarity than any mundane telescope. It’s why the king funds our research so deeply.”

“For what purpose, though?” one of the students asked. “What are you looking for out there?”

“We don’t know.”

That confused the prospective students. “Huh?”

“If we knew what was out there, we wouldn’t need to go looking for it, young ones,” Gallian explained. “What we know is so limited to what we have experienced and can perceive in our own world. Dragons and war shaped the fate of our star. But what came before that? What exists beyond that? What is the origin of life? Are there other places like our world out there? Are there strange things we would not understand even if we witnessed them? We don’t know. The study of astronomy is the research into the unknown void to get answers to questions we didn’t even know we had. And by answering those questions, we can begin to grasp the very foundations of the way our universe works.”

The astronomer’s enthusiasm was contagious, and he had the students fairly excited as they looked over the rest of the Observatory, and Ulrin was no exception. He was shown around to various tools and mechanisms that the astronomers and their students used to take readings and make calculations. Some of them were familiar: devices for helping do quick math or to copy notes from one page to another. Others, Ulrin had no idea what they were or what they were for. Such as a strange cylinder that had a bunch of balls of different sizes attached to it by a series of different-length strings. It reminded him of the ball-in-a-cup game he sometimes saw the peasant children play. Although with more balls attached.

As he fiddled with it, trying to divine its purpose, he was approached by Master Jeffries.

“I do hope you aren’t harming any of the valuable equipment here, young prince,” the Master of Students said.

Ulrin couldn’t exactly take offense at the statement. Not after the series of beakers he had accidentally dropped when they were in the chemistry lab. Or the lab coats he destroyed when he tried to clean it up. “I’m being careful, Master. I’m just trying to figure out what this thing is. Do you know?”

Jeffries sighed. “I do not. You’d have to ask Professor Gallian. I spent very little time up here, so I’m less familiar with this facility than the others. I expect it will be the same when you attend, young prince.”

That was the opposite of what Ulrin had expected. He was thinking of spending a lot of time here. Staring at the stars through a telescope, learning the secrets of the universe. That sounded more fun than the stodgy study of historical dead men or the kind of math that made his head hurt.

“Why is that, Master? This place looks to be at the forefront of its field. Surely that’s worth investing time in?”

“Oh, it’s certainly a fine facility. For those who want to spend their time studying astronomy, there is no better place on all the continent to do it,” Jeffries said. “It’s just not a practical science, young prince. The masses are easily amused by the stars and the heavenly bodies, so the Observatory is given a decent budget so they might find new ones to keep the people entertained. But that is all it is: entertainment. Never forget: The true purpose of research is to find ways to improve the lives of people. Whether that is finding a way to treat an illness or coming up with a weapon that will keep them safe from their enemies. Nothing that will help the lives of those of us living down here can be discovered out there.”

Ulrin felt himself deflate. “Professor Gallian seemed to think it was important.”

“Professor Gallian’s department budget is dependent on selling his research, young prince. Don’t be swayed by mild enthusiasm. As a member of the royal family, your chosen area of focused study is expected to be something of actual import. If you choose to follow in your brother’s footsteps and go into the sciences, then you will have your time quite full of chemistry, biology, the physical sciences, and so on. No time to waste on trivialities.”

The young Ulrin set the strange cylinder down, his momentary interest in learning something vanquished.

Now, returning here after all this time, Ulrin wondered how things would have been if he had gotten to enroll here. What would that have been like if the world hadn’t ended and he had become a student? It was something that he had dreaded. As far as his younger self knew, being forced to attend University was the worst thing that could happen to him.

But maybe that was just because of what was expected of him. And since when was Ulrin bound by what was expected of him? He’d already been known as a bit of troublemaker. Maybe he would have ditched the social circles of the obnoxious nobles and been friends with interesting commoners like Jeremiah, Lucas, and Renni. Perhaps he would have ignored Jeffries’s chiding and chosen astronomy as his area of focused study. Spending his days with good friends and his nights studying the stars. That actually sounded like a nice life. Instead of it being the worst part of his life, it might have been the best.

He would never know now. That same strange cylinder from when he was a kid still sat on the same table. Ulrin picked it up, still not sure what its purpose was. One of the strings had been cut, the ball missing. He wondered if that was intentional or if something had happened to damage the device in the chaos that overtook the school.

On a whim, he put the cylinder in his pack. It served no practical purpose; Jeffries was right about that. If anything, it was just extra weight. But for some reason, he felt a drive to bring it with him. Not like it was really stealing. His family had once funded this place.

None of this was helping him escape. He needed to put his memories aside and focus on the present.

He forced himself away from the bookshelves full of interesting astronomy lore, the oddly fantastic instruments of the research here, and the only-one-of-its-kind telescope that he had never gotten to look through, and focused his mind on finding a way out of there alive.

If there was one.`,

      content: `Cryaliss braced herself against the wall, holding her breath not to alert the Blind that was stalking her. She could hear it right on the other side of the wall, clicking with its mouth to try to locate her. It slowly paced back and forth by the wall. Its footsteps drew closer . . . closer . . .

Then it slowly started to move away. She waited until it had gained a bit of distance before she dared to breathe again.

She had been playing this game of cat and mouse with the Corrupted ever since she came back to the surface. While some of them had dispersed when they first lost sight of her, many still stalked this area, just waiting for her to reappear. She had been trying to find a way around them, but it seemed there was another creature every time she turned the corner. At this rate, finding Ulrin without accidentally leading the creatures back to him would be impossible, which would defeat the entire point.

Ulrin. Hopefully, he was okay. Cryaliss had managed to lure the majority of the horde after her, but she had not been able to attract all of them, and the last she saw of him, Ulrin was in a tough position. But if there was anyone who could survive in that scenario, it was him.

Alive or dead, she wouldn’t leave the University until she found out what happened to him.

That is, assuming she could leave at all. It was becoming apparent that she would not be able to go back the way she came.

After she had split off with Ulrin, she took a set of stairs down into a lower area of the campus. There were several small but tough-looking buildings there, some kind of fortified storage maybe, and she had hoped to get in one and barricade herself inside. But they all turned out to be locked. As the creatures started to close in on her from all sides, it seemed like she would be trapped.

Until, during her mad dash to escape, she tripped and fell face-first down into a sewer tunnel. Fortunately, it didn’t seem like it was getting much use lately in terms of human waste. Unfortunately, it was still filled with the muck that the Blood Rain had left behind. The whole front of her robes had become covered in the stuff. And right after she had just washed them.

For some reason, the Corrupted did not follow her down there. They must have seen her fall down, and she heard them milling about the entrance to the tunnel, but they did not come inside. She’d never seen the Corrupted put off from an area before. Maybe they were sensitive to the smells? Seemed unlikely.

She had waited in the sewers for nearly an hour before climbing back out to try to regroup with Ulrin. But she found herself unable to make a path back to the upper parts of the campus with this many of the Corrupted still lingering about and looking for her. At least, not this way.

There were branching paths to the sewer tunnel she had gone down, which were likely connected to the other parts of the University. She was loath to travel it, for one, because of how disgusting it was down there, and she had no sense of which direction those tunnels would lead. An underground sewer network, particularly one that would service as wide an area as the University, could have a quite complex layout, making it easy to get lost in.

But now she was running out of options if she wanted to get out of here while it might still be possible to find Ulrin. With an inward sigh, she snuck back to the sewer entrance and slowly lowered herself in. No sense in landing face-first in the muck again.

The sewers were dark, dank, and smelled terrible. The stench of waste, though no longer present, was still overwhelming. She did not even dare to open her mouth lest she breathe in enough to give her a horrible case of nausea.

The tunnel itself was rough and uneven. She had to be careful where she stepped, so she didn’t twist an ankle or break a leg. There were many cracks and pitfalls along the way, and if it wasn’t for her night vision, she likely would not have been able to navigate it safely. Yet even so, she still had a few close calls.

The first tunnel wasn’t very long. She reached an intersection and stopped to take stock of her surroundings. She had no idea what lay ahead.

She was presented with the option of three connecting tunnels. She found that each was marked by a wooden sign hanging on the wall. One read: Main Sewer Line, the other: To Research Tunnel, and the last: To Outlet.

The “Main Sewer Line” would probably run a loop around the major areas of the campus, with more branching paths connecting to offshoot tunnels like the one she had come from. She wasn’t sure where the “Outlet” would go to. The only body of water around was the man-made river surrounding the campus, and she doubted they were dumping their waste into it. She could follow it to find out, hoping that the outlet would be somewhere close and safe that would allow her to double back and find Ulrin, but there was also the risk that it would lead further down and eventually connect with the sewage systems of the surrounding region before being sent miles away.

The “Research Tunnel” option was interesting, though. She wondered what the reason would be for a research area to require its own sewer line. Why not simply connect it to the main line like the rest of the campus?

She had no way of knowing where Ulrin would go in the University. He knew the layout of the University or at least had a vague familiarity with it. This place was completely foreign to her. And even if she knew what building she was looking for, her odds of finding the right path through the main line were unlikely.

At least the research tunnel was a destination. It sounded like the kind of place that might house the sort of relics Ulrin was seeking. If she was lucky, he would head there, and they would meet up. Otherwise, maybe there would be a map or directory she could use to figure out where Ulrin would likely go.

It was better than wandering lost for hours, anyway. She set off down the tunnel, continuing to carefully pick her steps as she went.

Due to the darkness, she didn’t notice the changes in the tunnel at first. It wasn’t until she had been traveling the tunnels for at least half an hour that she realized the tunnel was narrowing. When she noticed that the walls were getting closer together, forcing her to step deeper into the muck, she stopped to take a closer look at her surroundings.

This area was newer. Or recently renovated. There were signs of recent construction. The stone used to line the walls was of a different type than in the rest of the tunnel. There were fewer signs of wear along the channel. And the smell wasn’t quite as bad.

Still bad, though.

The tunnel continued on for a little longer. Then, without warning, it abruptly ended.

There was a short gap in a section of the wall, just barely wide enough for her to squeeze through, but that was it. Beyond it was a massive pile of rubble. She looked around but could not see any other tunnels leading away from there.

She examined the area around the gap. There was some water wear at the base and the grooves of a sewage path. It was through this gap that the wastewater would have flowed out from what she presumed was the research area beyond. But someone had deliberately collapsed the pathway.

“Why go through all the trouble of constructing a new sewer line just to seal it off?” she wondered out loud to herself.

If it had happened after The Bleeding, it might have been a way to keep the Corrupted from getting through. But the Corrupted didn’t seem to go into the sewer tunnels, anyway.

Whatever the reason, it added a wrinkle to her progress. If she couldn’t go this way, she would have to backtrack to the branch and follow the route to the main line. Then she would have to wander aimlessly and hope she would eventually wind up in the right place.

Upon closer examination of the rubble, she saw that the pile wasn’t as deep as she had first thought. Whoever had collapsed this tunnel had done a rushed job of it. She thought she might clear it if she could remove some of the bigger pieces from the bottom.

It was tough to get leverage to remove the pieces with the small gap left for her. She crouched lower and lower until she was fully kneeling in the muck. Wiggling her fingers around in the rubble until she found purchase on something substantial, then pulling in a vertical jerk, she was able to pull out a sizable bit of stone. Smaller bits came raining down as the pile crumbled. She repeated this process twice, and the whole mound came loose and poured out of the gap.

It’d be a tight fit until she got through, but there was technically enough room for her to slip past now. She’d have to brush her back against the slimy upper wall, but given her current state, what was a little more slime?

The path started to lead upward at a high gradient. It was a short climb until she saw a hatch that would take her up and out. She didn’t sense any of the Corrupted nearby, but she still used caution while slowly lifting the hatch and peering out.

She found herself in some kind of laboratory. It reminded her of the alchemy equipment used by the Matrons back at the Blood Maidens’ temple, although at a much grander scale. There was a large table in the center of the room, covered with glassware and beakers. Bookshelves lined the walls, but instead of the expected tomes and publications, there was a disheveled collection of journals, loose notes, and packed folders.

There were also several tools and devices that Cryaliss was only remotely familiar with due to seeing the Matrons use similar objects, like some kind of chemical distiller and a pair of large glass tubes connected by a funnel. They looked like they might be holding blood.

As she braved climbing out of the hatch and into the lab, she noticed that the tubes were not the only objects that had that distinctive black-crimson stain of once being coated in blood. There were further tables lined up side-by-side, crammed together, so there was barely any room to pass between them, each covered in the same types of instruments.

Except for the last one at the end, which was covered in a red-stained sheet. By the outline of the sheet, it was clearly covering a body. That was when Cryaliss realized that these were not just ordinary tables. These were surgical tables. And from the looks of it, they had gotten a lot of use.

“Who was performing surgery down here?” Cryaliss asked.

She supposed it wasn’t unimaginable that a university would have a place for medical students to learn how to perform surgery. They might even have access to cadavers to practice on. But the state of the place did not look like a place of education. It was too small and cluttered to have many people gathered around, and even if the torch sconces were lit, it would still be shadowy and ill-suited for observation. Nor did it seem like a place of healing, much for the same reasons. No care was taken for the condition of the tools or for maintaining a clean environment.

Perhaps most disturbing, based on the state of the dried blood, while this place had not been used recently, the last time was not too long ago. Within the past year, maybe even within the last month.

“I doubt the Corrupted have taken a sudden interest in learning medicine.”

It was unlikely that whatever Ulrin was looking for would be found here. If Ulrin could even find this place at all. There weren’t any immediate signs of other entries to the lab, and despite having ascended a bit in the tunnel, she got the impression she was still underground. If she had to guess, this place had been hidden away, and unless Ulrin was also going to go sewer diving, he was unlikely to stumble upon it.

There was nothing here for her and no reason to linger. She knew she should go searching for another way out to get back to the campus and look for Ulrin. But curiosity compelled her to stay just a bit longer. There was something nagging her, an itch at the back of her mind that could only be scratched by investigating. It was something about the form under the sheet.

As she stood at the foot of the surgery table, she knew nothing good would come from her curiosity. Whatever was under there was best left undisturbed, another nameless body in the middle of the apocalypse. But she had to know.

She pulled the sheet back and was so startled by what she saw that she nearly fell over backward. Her leg caught the back of the table as she stumbled, knocking over a pile of pages that had been kept in a bin underneath and pouring them across the floor.

It was a Corrupted. One of the Crawlers. Or most of one. This one had been killed partway through its transformation. The extra appendages had started to sprout but had yet to form spiked hooks at the end, looking more like fleshy bulbs at this point. The face was still more human than not as well, twisted even now in a pained expression.

The body had been cut open and thoroughly dissected.

Taking a deep breath to steady herself, she stepped back toward the table. She bent over and picked up the pile of loose pages that had fallen on the floor, quickly scanning the top of the pages.

Subject 19. Stage of Transformation – 2B / 2C mix.

Type of Transformation – Variant 4 Southeast

Time from Infection to Euthanasia: ~6 hours

Blood Toxicity Level: 21%

Notes: Subject showed signs of late-stage mental break, likely due to the stress and pain of the transformation, but had not yet been overtaken by the infection’s control.

All transformations are external at this point. Organs retain their human form. Staining on the liver, but likely caused by excessive alcohol consumption over a lifetime and not a result of the Corruption.

B and C cells present in the blood. This provides further weight to the theory.

Process still unreversible, but at this level, possibly dilutable. Need more fresh blood samples to test.

Need a subject at phase 3A to extrapolate data.

Somebody was down here studying the Corrupted. A very hands-on study. Whoever had been on that table had been nothing but a test subject for this researcher.

She started to flip through the other notes, and what she read painted a picture that made her sick.

The stated goal of the research was to find a way to cure and, failing that, stall the transformation into a Corrupted after exposure to the Blood Rain or infected blood. A noble effort, but the methods were terrifying.

They’d gather victims of the Blood Rain and bring them down to the lab. It was unclear, but they might have even contributed to the infection. They’d then strap their “subjects” to these tables and watch them transform, taking notes the whole time about changes to the body and mental state. At whatever part of the transformation they wanted to learn more about, they would “euthanize” the subject. Then they would dissect it and take samples of its blood to run tests. They did this with at least twenty different people of varying ages and backgrounds.

It was disgusting and yet fascinating. She couldn’t help but continue to read. So far, the Corrupted to her had seemed unknowable, a curse that affected a man and turned them into a monster. But to see it treated with a scientific eye, even a callous and cruel one such as was presented by this researcher, was somewhat . . . comforting. If the process could be analyzed, explained by science, perhaps that meant there was a technical way of countering it.

The last few pages did not deal with the subjects themselves but with the collected findings of the researcher. Here things were a bit more of a jumbled mess, as the researcher would cross out theories as they were disproved, write over others, and make changes to mathematical equations requiring him to rework entire formulas on another page. But what caught her eye here was the drawings the researcher had made of his theorized structures for Corrupted blood cells. These drawings were very familiar to her.

They were part of the Symbology of the Blood Maidens.

These symbols were important parts of the process of Bludsifting, the process of turning the raw secretions of the BludSeed into usable Drakenblud. The way the researcher had drawn them was off. It was like he was drawing their reflection in a mirror. But they were still unmistakable.

What could this mean? Were the Blood Maidens more directly connected to the Blood Rain than she had thought? Was this what the Matrons knew, what they had been working in seclusion up in their quarters to resolve?

Cryaliss dropped the pages, no longer finding any comfort in them. She wanted to leave this place, and now.

It took some searching, but she was eventually able to find a lever that opened a secret passageway. The passage led up some stairs to a wall where another lever opened a new hidden door.

This one took her into a large room filled with more books than she had ever seen in her life. More than she thought ever existed. Five floors, she counted, each one filled to the brim with stacks and racks and shelves of books. The upper floors ran in a square around the open center of the room, so by looking up, you would see what appeared to be a great tower of perfectly symmetrical shelves.

She wondered if it was all science and history and other educationally important topics or if there was also fictional literature among them. There had to be. Those shelves were so vast; how could they have possibly filled them without it? It had been a long time since she had the chance to stop and read a new story. Maybe there would be time for her to find an interesting read. Or two reads. How many could she fit into her pack before weight became an issue?

As she glanced around in wonder at this magical place, she was surprised when she caught a look at a man sitting at a table in the center of the ground floor. A heavyset fellow with thick spectacles and wearing the colors of the University. A little old to be a student. Perhaps a teacher or a researcher.

That thought caused her to freeze up. Was he the one responsible for what she had seen in the lab below?

Even if he was, she couldn’t just avoid him. He was one of the kingdom’s few survivors. She needed to check that he was healthy and properly supplied, and if not, how she might be able to aid him.

Plus, he might have seen Ulrin. The library would have been a logical place for Ulrin to search if he had made it this far.

“Excuse me,” she said softly, trying to be careful not to spook him.

He looked up from the book he was invested in, a thick bound tome with a bunch of symbols Cryaliss couldn’t understand. “Who are you? How did you get in here?”

“Sorry to disturb you. I am Cryaliss. I was just wondering—”

“How did you get in here?” he repeated, cutting her off. “Did you break the front door? Did you let any of those things in? I swear, if you have ruined the security of this place . . .”

“No! No, I did not,” she insisted. “I came in from below. From the sewers.”

He sniffed the air. “Well, you certainly smell like it. But how could you get in here from the sewers? I set an entire bookcase atop that hatch.” His eyes narrowed. “That’s a Blood Maiden’s robe, isn’t it? Do you possess some kind of supernatural strength?”

“No. Well, yes, I am a Blood Maiden, but no, I do not possess greater than normal strength. I came up of the sewers into the lab below the library and out through a secret passage.”

“Please! I held a prestigious position as one of the University’s top researchers for years before The Bleeding. If there was a secret lab, they’d have let me know about it. Hell, they’d have begged me to work in it.”

She just pointed to the opening of the passage she had come out of. By his expression, he was honestly surprised to see it.

Well, that answers that question, Cryaliss thought. He’s not the same researcher who performed those experiments on the Corrupted.

“Fuckers!” he exclaimed. “What kind of secret research could they have done that wouldn’t have benefited from my mind? Fools. I hope whatever it was blew up in their faces!”

Cryaliss kept a few paces back from this strange man. This was not how she expected this interaction to go, and she was not sure what he would do next. “Are you alright here? Do you have food? I could—” she started, intent on sharing her meager supplies if he needed them.

“I have my own,” he again interrupted, his tone curt. “None to share, so you can just get out of here. This library isn’t big enough for both of us.”

She looked around at the massive, five-floored building.

“I meant that figuratively,” he said. “As in, I don’t want to share it. I’m busy and don’t need anyone distracting me, much less a Blood Maiden with whatever kind of weird shit you got going on. Now I suggest you leave.”

She had thought Ulrin was bad at interacting with people, but this researcher made him seem like a paragon of charm. “That is fine. I will go. But quickly, before I do, did you see a companion of mine? Ul . . . Maxwell. A man about this tall, wearing a cloak, carrying a peculiar sword.”

He waved his hand dismissively. “Yeah, I saw him outside. Based on the racket out there, I’d say he was taking the catwalks to the Observatory.” He gestured in the general direction. “Being chased by a lot of the Corrupted, though. No idea if he made it. If you want my advice, I’d head in the opposite direction.”

The Observatory. Well, it was a start.

“Thank you,” she said as politely as she could manage. “I’ll leave you to your books.”

“My important research.”

“Of course.”

He watched her as she walked to the front door, unsealed it, and stepped outside. A moment after, she heard the door resealing behind her.

“At least he didn’t try to kill me for being a Blood Maiden,” she said. “That’s an improvement over some.”

Heading in the direction of the Observatory, she saw the disastrous remains of the catwalk and feared the worse. Quickly scanning the area, she saw another path up that was still mostly intact and rushed to it.

She ran in such a hurry that she forgot to reach out with her senses first and was thus unaware of the danger she was sprinting toward.`,

      content: `What an unfortunate interruption to his studies that had proven to be. The nerve of some people to just barge in uninvited like that. As if all the seals and barricades he had placed on every entrance to the library had not been an ample enough indication that he did not want to be disturbed.

Well, almost every entrance. Bayliff would have never guessed that there was a secret laboratory under the library. If the Master of Students was still around and not a gibbering monster, he’d have some choice words for him.

Nothing to be done about it now. He ensured the front door was sealed after the Blood Maiden had left, then jammed the mechanism on the secret passage to make sure no one else would be coming back up that way. Once that was done, he could get back to his work.

It had been a lot of effort to get back to this library. Opening a path through the dome and setting a trap, so the first student to pass through it would alert every creature in the area to their presence, all without getting caught himself, was quite a feat. And it had worked perfectly. Of course, he expected his plans to work, but he did have some concern that whoever ended up with the unfortunate role of bait would have died without providing enough time for Bayliff to reach the library unnoticed. But he had luckily snagged a couple of real survivors. Bayliff hadn’t even been forced to use any of his stash of firebombs on his journey.

Getting back to his lab might be an issue if he didn’t have the fortune of another distraction, but it wasn’t a high priority. He had taken everything of critical importance with him, including the Pentahedron. A shortage of rations, as he could only carry so much, but he would make do.

All of that effort was paying off in spades. With access to all the library’s books on BludSeeds and the related Symbology, he was making progress in a day that would have taken him months to re-engineer on his own. He had already managed to confirm some of his theories, discount the others, and fill in the gaps with historical data. All that remained was putting it all together to form the grand picture.

This was what it meant to be a genius. Others less gifted wouldn’t understand.

Being in the library again reminded him of that. He had always been mocked, ridiculed, outcast just because his mind was sharper than everyone else’s. By the age of fourteen, he had contributed more books to this library than most scholars would in their lifetime. But instead of being respected and admired by his peers, they attacked him.

There were the normal pranks, swapping out his equipment, putting bugs in his bed, and swapping out the room numbers on classroom assignments to make him late. He remembered one week when it had gotten particularly bad. He’d spotted a couple of students engaged in passionate relations hidden in a secluded alcove on the top floor of the library and reported them to the head librarian. This was supposed to be a place of learning, after all, not of carnal fulfillment. For the whole week following, his uniform would disappear every time he took a shower. He had to take a few embarrassing walks in nothing but a towel to requisition a new one.

The worst of it, though, was when they defaced his books. Those books were his contribution to the library, part of his legacy of research, and meant to expand the common knowledge. Knowledge was supposed to be separate from the petty squabbles of the men who sought it. Yet they did such damage to his books they were deemed “unsalvageable” and needed to be discarded.

That was when he realized that most people were too emotional to put aside trivial matters for the sake of scientific advancement. They could have used his work as the basis for their own studies and made new discoveries that would have built upon it, earning a legacy for themselves in the process, but instead, they would rather tear him down because they did not like him. But he needn’t associate with them, not any more than was required. He wouldn’t let emotions dictate his actions. His would be a life of the mind and the pursuit of progress.

And look where that led. All those that had tormented him had died, and he had not only survived but was on the verge of a major breakthrough that would allow him to combat their killers. If this was a contest, he’d say he won.

It was just a matter of one final cross-reference, and yes, here it was, the secrets of the operation of the BludSeed and, thus, the Pentahedron. Yes, this would be a powerful weapon indeed. With a little configuring, an entire horde of Corrupted could be wiped out in an instant. He had all the Symbology required now to do the configuration itself. All that would be required then to activate it would be for the power to pass through an activation channel. Something with a direct connection to the BludSeed.

A Blood Maiden.

He put down his book.

“Fuck.”

He had just sent what was perhaps the last living Blood Maiden off to her probable death. She was right there, the answer to all his work, and he had let her go.

“Fuck! You better not be dead already!”

He grabbed his jacket, along with its pocketed supply of firebombs, and rushed toward the door.

“I swear, if you’re dead already, I will chase you to the next life and kill you myself!”

Okay, he would admit that sometimes it was a little hard to control his emotions.`,

      title: "Chapter 18",
      content: `With his leg in its current condition and the pain in his shoulder only increasing, the last thing Ulrin wanted to be doing right now was climbing. Unfortunately, he had determined that it was the only course for escaping the Observatory without alerting the Corrupted.

It was a bit of inspiration that he would have been just as happy not having. The top of the telescope went through a slot in the roof to have an unobstructed view of the sky. Pull back the telescope a bit, and you could then climb it to squeeze out of that slot and onto the roof yourself. Assuming you could climb that high at a steep angle. And the telescope remained stable and didn’t turn under your weight. And the roof was even still in a condition that it could be stood on.

A lot of what-ifs. But it beat the guarantee of being trapped until he ran out of supplies, so it was a risk he would have to take.

His uninjured side had to do the heavy lifting, as his wounded shoulder could hardly support his weight, and if he tried to push up with his banged knee, it would likely buckle and cause him to fall. This led to a lopsided climb that took him twice as long as it should have, if not more. But he was able to slowly make his way up the length of the telescope.

He briefly wondered what Jeffries and the rest of the Masters would have thought about how he was using the equipment. One of the most expensive scientific apparatuses in all the kingdom, and he was using it as a glorified ladder. Jeffries probably would have lost his mind.

The slot was just barely wide enough for him to squeeze through. Pulling himself up by his good shoulder, he managed to get up and onto the roof.

A faint twinkling of light was starting to fill the sky, the first he had seen in weeks. Looked like they might get sunlight today. That would certainly change things. Instead of sneaking around, he could just wait for the sun to come out and make searching the campus that much safer. Well, the outdoor parts of the campus, anyway. If all the Corrupted ran inside, that would make the buildings that much more dangerous. Still beat the alternative.

He just wished he had known that before he had started climbing. Now that he was all the way up here, he didn’t much feel like climbing all the way down to camp in the Observatory until daylight. Maybe he would just stay on the roof. Then again, it was still going to be several hours before the sun truly came out. If one of those jumping creatures decided to pay a visit up here in the meantime, he’d be in trouble.

Better to find a place out of the open to wait. As soon as it was daylight, he could then scour the campus for a sign of where Cryaliss had gone.

As it turned out, he was not going to have to search at all. When he stepped over to the side of the roof to look for a safe way down, he spotted Cryaliss rushing along the catwalks toward the Observatory. Some coincidence.

While it was relieving to see she was still alive, it was less so that she was running straight toward the Corrupted he knew were hiding just out of sight of the Observatory door. And given the speed she was going, she didn’t seem to sense that they were there.

What was the point of having the ability to sense Corrupted if you weren’t going to use it? Ulrin thought.

Now what? If he called out to warn her, he would alert all the creatures to his location, defeating the purpose of his climb. If he didn’t, she was going to get ambushed.

Before he could make up his mind, he spotted a shadow moving toward her at an inhuman pace.

“Cryaliss!” he shouted, his own safety taking a backseat to the immediate danger she faced. “Cryaliss! Look out! To your left!”

Cryaliss turned just in time to see the Blind rushing toward her. She ran back the other way, only to find more creatures now having gathered in the path behind. They were boxing her in.

Ulrin looked around the roof’s edges, desperate to find a safe way down so he could help her. He found none.

“Oh, I’m sorry, ankle. Neither of us is going to like this.”

He leaped down onto a landing between him and the catwalks. With unusual grace, he was able to turn his momentum into a roll, negating the worst of the pain of the impact. Feeling moderately impressed with himself, he proceeded to leap from the landing to the closest of the surviving catwalks.

This time, he was less graceful. His injured leg buckled upon touching the ground, throwing off his balance and sending him down onto the side instead of into another roll. Only by quickly catching the railing did he manage to keep himself from going face-first over the side.

Growling with pain and effort, he pulled himself up using the railing and started limping toward Cryaliss as quickly as he could. The Blind he had spotted first was just behind her, its uncanny speed allowing it to gain on her with every stride. It was almost within reach to grab her with its claws just as they crossed on the walkway that ran directly under Ulrin.

With a prayer to whatever god watched over his legs, Ulrin took one more jump, drawing Silverlight as he fell. He plunged the sword directly beneath him, skewering the Corrupted as he landed atop it.

Landing atop the creature cushioned his fall somewhat, but he still felt the jolt of pain from his ankle as it bent back into the position it should not be in. He stumbled forward and nearly fell, but was caught by Cryaliss.

“Ulrin?” she said as she held him up. There were many layers to the surprise on her face.

Before he could respond, she pointed behind him. “Ulrin!”

Without even looking at what he was swinging at, Ulrin performed a spinning slash at whatever was coming up behind him. Silverlight pierced through the torso of a Crawler just before it could put its hooks into him. Its legs continued forward for a moment while its half-severed upper body slumped back, causing the body to snap along its spine before crumpling.

“We can’t stay here,” Ulrin said. “Let’s go. But this time, no running off on your own.”

“I was just trying to—”

Ulrin grabbed her arm and started to pull her along before she could finish her thought. Ulrin had left the Observatory door locked, so rushing back that way was pointless, but if they could take the steps to the ground level, they might find an open classroom somewhere to barricade. It didn’t have to hold long, just until daylight.

That was assuming it wasn’t too far. With his leg in its current condition, he wasn’t going to be able to sprint too far before they were caught. If that happened, he’d have to fight.

They reached the stairs and practically flew down them. They had just about reached the ground when another pack of creatures suddenly appeared at the base of the stairs. Five of them, each of them one of the larger varieties of Corrupted. There would be no way around them. Even if they jumped over the side for the rest of the way down, those beasts would be upon them before they took a single step.

Behind them, a ravenous horde was descending the stairs toward them. Ulrin hadn’t gotten the chance to count the numbers, but he assumed most of the group that had stalked him here was still present, plus perhaps a few new additions, thanks to all the noise.

Going back wasn’t an option. They would have to go through if they couldn’t go around the Corrupted in front. Ulrin raised his sword into an aggressive position and prepared to rush at the pack. The odds were slim that he could take them all out before one of them got the finishing strike on him, but if he could take them down with him, maybe Cryaliss could at least get away.

A blast of fire erupted in front of him, engulfing the Corrupted and causing the stairs to judder. A wave of heat hit Ulrin in the face, and a bright light nearly blinded his darkness-adjusted eyes. The creatures shrieked and ran, only making it a short distance before collapsing, their bodies still ablaze.

“This way!” A man appeared in front of them. To Ulrin’s surprise, he was pretty sure it was the same man who had locked him out of the library.

“You!” Ulrin shouted.

“You again,” Cryaliss added.

“Yes, me. Now let’s go, idiots!” the man shouted. “They’re right behind you!”

The man took off running back in the direction of the library. Ulrin would have rather stabbed the guy than trust him to lead them to safety, but in his current state, he couldn’t be picky with his choice of saviors. With a quick nod to Cryaliss, the two followed after their mysterious rescuer.

He could always stab him later if he felt like it.`,

      title: "Chapter 19",
      content: `The moment the library doors sealed behind them, Cryaliss doubled over, gasping to try to catch her breath. Sweat dripped down her face and stung her eyes, but it wasn’t just the physical exertion that was getting to her. This wasn’t the first time she had faced danger, nor was it the first time she had come face-to-face with death. But there was no question in her mind that this was the closest she had come to dying. She had thought she had come to terms with the inevitability of death, something she even felt she would welcome at some point. And yet, as it came to her, a primordial fear had swelled up inside her.

She had gone out there to try to aid Ulrin, but instead, Ulrin had quite nearly died protecting her. If he hadn’t shown up when he did . . .

And he was hurt, very hurt. She couldn’t just stand there recovering; she needed to see to his wounds.

As she straightened up and looked over to Ulrin to see how he was faring, she was surprised to see his sword still drawn and held out in front of him. For a moment, she feared that one of the Corrupted had made their way into the library with them, but as she followed the point of the sword, she saw it was held against their unlikely savior, the scholar.

“Maxwell!” she shouted, only just barely remembering his alias in her shock. “What are you doing?!”

The scholar held his hands defensively up at his sides, a sign of surrender, though his face looked more annoyed than frightened at the blade inches from his neck. “Relax. Put that thing down, would you? This is no way to treat someone who’s just saved your sorry ass.”

“Am I to believe you suddenly had a heroic instinct?” Ulrin snarled. “I should do to you what you did when we first met: Lock you outside with those creatures and leave you to fend for yourself.”

Ulrin’s face was twisted with anger, but Cryaliss could tell he was barely holding it together. He wobbled unsteadily on his feet, and the sword shook in his hands as he struggled to raise it. There was so much blood all over him, both fresh and clotted; it was likely only adrenaline keeping him standing at all. In this state, he couldn’t be thinking clearly. She needed to calm the situation before it was too late.

“Maxwell, he just saved us,” she said as she slowly approached Ulrin. She tried to maintain a steady voice that wouldn’t trigger Ulrin to strike. “Whatever he did before . . .”

“He’s a murderer and can’t be trusted,” Ulrin growled. “Not only did he try to kill me earlier, but I suspect he’s the one responsible for the trap we walked into when we got here.”

The scholar shrugged passively, which seemed a decisively poor decision in the situation, in Cryaliss’s opinion. “I won’t deny any of it. I did what I had to. You wouldn’t understand even if I tried to explain it to you. But that was then, and this is now. The variables have changed, and it now serves us all to cooperate.”

“Is that so?” Ulrin asked, his sword inching closer.

Cryaliss put a hand on Ulrin’s shoulder. “We should at least hear him out.”

“You should listen to your companion,” the scholar said. “Your behavior right now is most unseemly for someone of your status, Prince Ulrin.”

Ulrin’s eyes flickered in surprise.

“Wasn’t too hard to figure out,” the scholar continued. “You bear all the marks of the royal family. You’re too old to be Prince Tobias, and you’re a few inches short of Prince Gerevin. Your arrival here is unexpected. It’s a shame I didn’t get a good look at you during our first . . . encounter. I may have made a different decision then.”

To Cryaliss’s relief, Ulrin lowered his sword, though he still kept it in his hand. “So what? Now that you recognize me, you want to work together?”

The scholar began walking around Ulrin. “Well, not exactly. Your presence here is curious, and I would be interested to learn the reasons for your arrival. But it is your companion whose cooperation I require.” He stopped in front of Cryaliss and began to look her over. “A Blood Maiden.”

Now it was Cryaliss’s turn to be surprised. “When we met before, you said you didn’t want me around because you were worried about what my power might cause.”

He shrugged. “As I said, the variables have changed. As it turns out, my research has revealed that the artifact I am studying requires a Blood Maiden to operate. Thus, my sudden need for your talents.”

“An artifact?” she asked. “What does it do?”

“It is a weapon that can be used against the Corrupted. I will explain more, but first, we should probably attend to the prince.” He looked at Ulrin, who seemed ready to collapse at any moment. “I don’t want him bleeding out all over the library carpet. Come on, help me bring him to the back. There’s a supply of bandages and antiseptic.”

They brought Ulrin to the back section of the library, and the scholar, who introduced himself as Bayliff, went to work on cleaning, closing, and bandaging Ulrin’s wounds. His dexterity and precision were impressive, as skilled as even the most experienced of the Maidens. Cryaliss attempted to help, but Bayliff waved her off and told her she would just be in the way. Seeing him work, she couldn’t disagree.

“I’ve done what I can,” Bayliff said after he finished applying the last of the bandages to Ulrin’s shoulder. “Though I can only treat the surface injuries. Based on some of your bruising, it seems likely you also have internal injuries. If they are serious enough, you may already be dying.”

“Your bedside manner could use some work,” Ulrin grumbled.

“I can help him recover from those injuries,” Cryaliss said. “Though accelerating the body’s natural healing processes might be painful for him while he is conscious.”

“Hemalurgy. Interesting,” Bayliff noted. “There are notes in the books about the ability, but they are all second-hand accounts as the Maidens have never allowed one of our scholars to observe the practice; thus, its existence couldn’t be verified. I’d be interested to see it in action. As for the prince, I may be able to concoct a sleeping drought for the procedure.”

Ulrin glared at him. “Fall asleep around you? No thanks.” He then glanced at Cryaliss. “Just do what you need to. I can take it.”

Bayliff raised his hands helplessly. “Just offering to help. But very well.”

She kneeled over him and put a hand to his heart. The blood that pumped through his heart and to the rest of his body appeared to her as threads, and she traced them till she found where the threads had become frayed and torn. She forced the body’s lifeblood to flow more rapidly to these tears and used the excess to stitch the threads together. One string after another, the threads started to become whole once more.

Ulrin was attempting to withstand the treatment with silent stoicism, but Cryaliss could see how he clenched his teeth and clamped his fists tight. The process was not easy for her, either. Even well rested, this ability drained her. Exhausted as she was, it felt as though she was attempting to run a marathon after not sleeping for a week. She forced herself on until the last of the threads had been restored, and Ulrin’s blood flew through a hale body once more.

She collapsed next to him once she was done, hardly able to keep her eyes open anymore.

“I see. The process consumes internal energy to apply pressure to the external force,” Bayliff commented as he looked down at her. “That may actually be useful information. It may allow me to reason the limiting factors in the operation of the Pentahedron, presuming the forces at work are roughly equivalent.” He tapped a finger to his chin as he thought. “Yes, I believe I will get to work narrowing down the details of this hypothesis. You both get some rest. By the time you’ve recovered, I should be ready for you. Though, do try not to keep me waiting too long.”

With that, Bayliff walked off back toward the front of the library, leaving Ulrin and Cryaliss lying on the hard floor with no energy to get back up or even get into a more comfortable position.

“I don’t think I like this guy very much,” Ulrin said.

“He’s . . . certainly lacking in charms,” Cryaliss agreed. “But he has helped us. And he claims to have a weapon we can use against the Corrupted. That’s the whole reason we’re here, isn’t it?”

“Yeah. Still want to punch him in the face, though.”

“Well, that’s a step up from wanting to stab him.”

Despite the harshness of the floor, exhaustion soon saw the both of them drifting off to sleep.

---

“Stop your fucking squirming, kid. I swear I’ll cut you before your daddy even gets here if you keep making a ruckus.”

Ulrin went still. His eyes filled with tears, and he once again began to cry, but he didn’t move. He was too frightened to.

How did he get here? It was all so blurry.

He was out with his mother. She wanted to take him to see the gardens in the capital. They’d be surrounded by a large escort, royal guardsmen mixed with the queen’s personal attendants. The carts were sent ahead because he wanted to walk.

They were almost at the gardens when there was a commotion. Some men appeared with weapons. They looked like they were trying to attack his mother. The guards rushed to protect the queen. No one was looking at Ulrin. They were all focused on the attackers.

So, no one noticed when a hand reached out from the shadows and pulled Ulrin away.

Now, he was stuck in some place he didn’t recognize, surrounded by scary men he did not know. One was holding him down and had a large knife in his other hand. Was he about to be hurt?

Was he about to die?

The tears came out faster, and his sobs became louder.

“Can’t you keep that brat quiet?” one of the men asked, annoyed.

“I’m doing my best,” replied the one holding him down. “But ain’t much I can do. Royal brat’s only eight. At that age, it doesn’t matter how big the bed of gold he was born into is. Still going to cry for his mommy when it gets wet.”

“Well, I’m tired of fucking hearing it. I’m going to find something to close that mouth of his in a second.”

Before he could make good on his promise, there was a banging on the room’s sole door. It was rhythmic, two knocks, three times.

This seemed to be what all the men in the room had been waiting for. They all rushed to positions around the room and put their hands on weapons. Except for the one holding Ulrin down, who only tightened his grip.

The door opened, and in walked Ulrin’s father, followed by another of the strange men close behind him.

“Father!” Ulrin cried out and tried to rush to him, only to be shoved back down.

“Well, well, the king actually showed up.” One of the men, a shifty fellow who wore all black and whom Ulrin had seen giving orders to the others, stepped into the center of the room. He was carrying a strange-looking crossbow. “You better hope my associate confirms you came alone, or you’re going to watch your precious son bleed out in front of you.”

The king did not respond, nor did he even seem to glance at Ulrin. His expression was stony.

The man directly behind the king spoke out. “Ain’t no one else out there, boss. I scouted the entire block. It’s empty, just like you said it would be. Not so much as a bird making a peep.”

“Good,” their leader replied. “Then we can keep things friendly. For now.”

“What is your grievance, bandit?” Ulrin’s father finally spoke.

“Grievance?” the kidnapper’s leader replied in a mocking tone.

“What do you hope to accomplish by luring me here, kidnapping the prince?” the king clarified, ignoring the chide. “You asked for no ransom. If you have a political demand, be out with it. If this was all a plot to try to assassinate me, it is a dreadfully poorly conceived one, but I would prefer if we got on with it, anyway.”

“Have places to be, Your Highness? Am I interrupting something important?”

“I’ve cleared my schedule for you, bandit, so you needn’t worry about my time. My only concern is for my son. I want him free of this as quickly as possible. Release him, and we can spend as much time as you desire on whatever you are planning.”

Ulrin let out another small sob. “Father . . .”

The bandit leader sighed dramatically. “Sorry, I haven’t decided yet whether or not I’m going to let the princeling go after this. He’s probably worth a lot of coin to the right people. Or the wrong people. I guess it all depends on what my mood is like after. And you’ve started me off in a bad mood already by calling me ‘bandit.’”

The king’s expression did not change. “What do you prefer?”

“Names are not important, just not bandit. I did not train for years to become one of Irimire’s top assassins to be insulted thus. And I also don’t appreciate you calling my assassination plot ‘dreadfully poorly convinced.’ I’ll have you know, I took this job with the utmost seriousness. And look! I got you alone, surrounded, unarmed. I’d say it is all going swimmingly for me.”

“So, it is an assassination plot.” King Emberlind glanced around the room. “I’ll stick with my assessment. You did not bring nearly enough men to kill the King of Lorn.”

“Ah, because of the Drakenblud, yes?” The assassin held up his strange crossbow. “You must think that your strength will allow you to survive, even unarmed. But I came prepared. I am a professional, after all. This is an Irimian crossbow, the latest innovation of its kind. It can put a bolt through six inches of steel. I don’t care how tough you think your flesh is; this will put you down.”

Ulrin, fearful for his father upon hearing all that, struggled in vain against his captor. “No! Please! I’m sorry, Father! This is all my fault.”

The king finally acknowledged him with a glance. “Calm yourself, Ulrin. There is nothing here to fear. I promise. We are Emberlind. We do not bow to lesser men. And we certainly aren’t killed by them.”

That seemed to get under the assassin’s skin. “Is that right? Well, how about we put that to the test?”

Without another word of warning, he fired the crossbow at the king. Ulrin shut his eyes, fearful of seeing his father hurt.

There were gasps all around him. None of them were his father’s.

Ulrin opened his eyes and saw the king standing firm. He held the bolt he had plucked from midair in an outstretched arm.

The talkative assassin was finally rendered speechless.

Things suddenly exploded into action. The king threw the bolt at Ulrin’s captor. The bolt pierced through the man’s eye socket. Blood spurted from the wound and rained down upon Ulrin as the man struggled for a bit before eventually releasing him and dropping him to the ground.

Another man had already reached his father with a sword coming down for a strike. The king hit the flat of the blade with the back of his hand, and the blade shattered. He quickly followed it with an open-palmed strike at the man’s chest. The man’s body crumpled in on itself at the point of impact and was sent flying across the room.

Ulrin was stuck in a state of shock. All the blood and violence were something he had never experienced before. A stranger’s blood was all over him. What should he do?

He shut his eyes and heard another shout and another body impacting the wall.

“Do not look away, Ulrin!” his father commanded. “These men attempted to take our lives. You must be willing to look an enemy in the eye and accept the weight of what needs to be done. Stay back and let me deal with them, but do not close your eyes.”

Though it frightened him, Ulrin did as he was told. What he witnessed was a terrifying display of the true might of the Emberlinds and the Drakenblud within them. The assassins might as well have been rag dolls in the hands of an angry child for how easily and roughly they were knocked away, how their bodies crumpled into unnatural positions with no resistance. Their blood left streaks through the air before scattering across the walls, floors, and windows, and yet none of it seemed to get on the king as if it did not dare to. One of the assassins screamed and tried to run past the king and to the door, but only half of him made it to the other side.

It was over quickly, but to Ulrin, it had felt like an eternity. He could still hear the screaming ringing in his ears. What kind of monster was his father?

Only the leader of the assassins remained. His bravado had completely abandoned him. A wet spot had formed at the front of his pants.

“Tell me who hired you,” the king commanded. “And I might let you live. I’m not sure yet. It depends on my mood, as you said.”

“I— I don’t know,” the assassin stumbled. “I don’t ask for details. I just take the coin.”

“Pity.” With a movement so quick Ulrin’s eyes couldn’t catch it, the king rushed forward, grabbed the assassin around the head, and twisted to snap his neck.

Ulrin slowly approached his father after the last body fell, trembling. “Father?”

The king kneeled before him. “Are you harmed, Ulrin?”

“N-No, I’m okay. But . . .” He looked at the body in front of him.

“I know it can be hard to stomach, and in truth, I wish you had been older before you had to. But we must take life’s lessons as they are given. As those entrusted with the Drakenblud, when called upon to fight, to kill, we must be ready to do so. Whether that is to defend ourselves or defend our kingdom. And you must be able to do so without looking away.”

“Will I . . . When I get older, will I be able to do the same thing?”

His father nodded. “When you become Bludded, you will be every bit as strong as I am. Perhaps stronger. But we can talk more about it later. Your mother is worried sick about you, and my advisers are likely pulling their hair out about my absence. Let’s get back to them, shall we?”

He held out his hand for Ulrin to take, and though Ulrin was scared before, the familiar gesture put him at ease. At the end of the day, that was still his father. Stern, a bit grumpy, but who loved and cared for him. And protected him, no matter what.

Ulrin took his father’s hand, and together they left the bloody scene behind.

---

Ulrin didn’t know how long he had been asleep, though the aching of his back from the hard floor suggested it had been a while. At least the pain from his myriad of injuries had dulled to minor throbbing. He was far from comfortable, but he could press on like this.

The first thing he became aware of was how thirsty he was. He remembered how Cryaliss’s healing left him in need of replenishing his body’s fluids. The second thing he noticed was an unusual weight on his arm.

It appeared that at some point during their rest, Cryaliss had taken his arm for a pillow. Likely unintentionally, as she did have a habit of tossing and turning during her sleep. Still, she seemed quite comfortable there. He felt waking her by removing his arm would be rude. Especially after she had just saved his life, and not for the first time.

That survival instinct that warned him not to get too close to anyone again tickled the back of his mind, but it was much quieter around her now. It was impossible to ignore that he trusted her completely. Not only that, but he valued her, not just as someone who had proven useful but as a companion. A few months ago, he would have thought it wild if it had been suggested that he would so overtly risk his life for someone else while he still had his mission to accomplish.

And she had risked her life for him in turn. Maybe this was what it meant to truly survive. Something that most of humanity had forgotten in their desperate struggle. To have someone you are willing to protect and who is willing to protect you.

He could feel her soft breathing against his arm. It was pleasant, and there was a gentle rhythm to it. He decided just to lie there and watch her sleep—for a little while, anyway. To be polite. Hopefully, she did not catch him this time.

When he had first met her, well . . . when he had first gotten a good look at her after she had gotten dressed, he had thought she was kind of plain-looking. Now he was growing more aware of the gentle arch of her lips, the curves of her body, the sheen of her hair. He wondered how she would have looked if she had ever come to court, dressed in the finery of the Lorn nobility, with her hair and makeup done by the royal stylists.

It wouldn’t suit her, he decided. Her natural look, dressed in her robes of the Blood Maidens, fit her.

It struck him all of a sudden how inappropriate it was to have these thoughts about his companion. A momentary slip of his tired mind. He needed to get up.

He tried to gently remove her from his arm, but despite his best efforts, she still began to wake.

“Hmm? What is . . .” She noticed where her head was resting and quickly moved away. “Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. I must have . . . in my sleep. Hope I didn’t bother you.”

“No, it’s fine. I was just getting up, anyway. Thirst is killing me. Should probably check that the scholar hasn’t set up anything fishy while we were out.”

They took a moment to compose themselves and for Ulrin to drink his fill from their water supply and then made their way to the front of the library. Bayliff was there at one of the tables, surrounded by a pile of books and a strange-looking device.

“Finally,” Bayliff greeted them. “I was wondering how long the two of you intended to keep me waiting. If you had tried to sleep much longer, I was planning to go back there and dump water on your heads.”

Ulrin glanced at Cryaliss. “It’s not too late for me to kill him, you know.”

“Maybe later.”

They approached Bayliff, and Ulrin’s attention went to the strange-looking device. “Is this the artifact you were mentioning? The one that can be used as a weapon against the Corrupted?”

“In theory, yes,” Bayliff responded.

“In theory?”

“Well, I haven’t exactly been able to get it to work just yet,” Bayliff explained. “But through my research, I have a fairly high confidence that I know the functionality of the Pentahedron.”

“And that is?”

Bayliff took a tone like he was lecturing a child. “The Pentahedron was devised as a weapon to be used against the dragons. It turns their Blud, the source of their power, against them and tears them apart from the inside. Given the nature of the Corruption and how distilled the crimson rain is compared to raw Blud, I expect that the Pentahedron, once activated, will have the potential to kill hundreds of Corrupted at a time, though I won’t be able to truly calculate its maximum potential until I’ve seen it in action at least once.”

“Hundreds?” If so, it was far and away more powerful than anything Ulrin had hoped to find here. “It sounds too good to be true.”

“Well, it may not be free,” Bayliff admitted. “Energy has to come from somewhere. The Pentahedron is controlled via a connection with a BludSeed at its core.”

“A BludSeed!” Cryaliss exclaimed. “I thought all known BludSeeds were kept at the temple. No wonder you require a Blood Maiden to activate it.”

Bayliff nodded. “Having witnessed the drain your use of Hemalurgy took on your body, I expect the far greater energy requirement for using the Pentahedron to truly push your body to its limits. It may, in fact, be lethal to its user.”

Ulrin slammed his hands on the table, knocking over a pile of books. “What? You can’t be serious! I’m not going to let her use this thing if it could kill her!”

Cryaliss looked stunned. “Ulrin . . .”

The scholar just shrugged, looking unimpressed at Ulrin’s rage. “I said, ‘it may.’ I don’t really have a baseline on the energy requirements to heal a person’s internal injuries, such as the ones I’ve witnessed, and I must make some assumptions. It may just make her incredibly tired.” He sighed. “If I had time and a host of test subjects, I may be able to get a better understanding of Blood Maidens’ talents and narrow the range of possible results. I’m just being honest about the potential.”

Well, this is a waste of time, Ulrin thought. A weapon that killed its wielder was of little use to them. Especially if Cryaliss was the one who would need to use it.

He was about to say as much when he saw Cryaliss had picked up the device and was examining it.

“Be careful!” Ulrin shouted at her.

Cryaliss didn’t look back at him. “If it would help, I would . . . I should . . . There isn’t anyone else alive who can use this now.”

“Not if it could kill you!” Ulrin insisted. “There’s got to be a better way!”

Bayliff scratched at his chin thoughtfully. “Prince Ulrin. Might I show you something?”

Ulrin’s response was to glare at him.

“It will only take a moment,” Bayliff added.

Reluctantly, Ulrin and Cryaliss followed Bayliff up to the third floor of the library, to a room marked as belonging to the head librarian. A thick steel bar had been placed across the door. Bayliff removed the bar and opened the door to reveal, to the horror of his witnesses, the shriveled form of a Corrupted. Chains bound its emaciated body, and the walls of the room were covered in bloody scratches from its escape attempts.

“What the hell is this?” Ulrin uttered.

“He once was a colleague of mine,” Bayliff explained. “His name was Bjorn. A brilliant mind and a great loss. In the early days following The Bleeding, he had the misfortune of coming in contact with Corrupted blood. Instead of despairing about his situation, Bjorn asked that we use this opportunity to learn. Specifically, he wanted us to use him to study a theory about the biological degradation of the Corrupted.”

“He wanted to see if they died of old age?” Ulrin asked.

“More than that. He wanted to see if they degraded as they expended energy. As I said before, energy has to come from somewhere. For most of us, it’s in the food we eat and the water we drink. But Corrupted are not observed eating anything. They act as hunters, but once their prey is dead, they lose all interest in it. Yet they must be expending tremendous energy to maintain their superhuman strength. It was theorized then that the Corrupted must eventually starve and degrade, even if they do so at a slower speed due to their mutations.”

Ulrin looked at the chained body again. “I haven’t seen any starved Corrupted on my travels. You’d think by this point they’d all be dropping dead if it was that easy.”

Bayliff scratched his chin. “This theory was proposed in the early days, back when we still had hope that the kingdom could be saved. We learned that, yes, they would degrade over time. However, they have a frequent source of energy being delivered to them which forestalls and even reverses any degradation.” He pulled a vial from a nearby shelf filled with a familiar murky red liquid. “The crimson rain.”

He splashed the small amount of liquid on the body of the Corrupted. Almost immediately, which had seemed to be dead and rotting, showed signs of life. Its body twitched, and muscle began to return to its form. It howled as it tried to rise back to its feet, though the chains held it down.

“It was still alive . . .” Cryaliss whispered.

“This is the truth about what we are up against, Prince Ulrin,” Bayliff explained. “Every time it rains, they are replenished. So long as the crimson rain continues to fall, we will never see the end of this. They will never starve, they will never age, and they will never grow any weaker. Waiting them out is not an option. We must be willing to take risks if we are to have any hope of making progress against them, and the Pentahedron is the most powerful weapon against them we have.”

What Bayliff said made sense; there was no denying that. There was only so much he could do fighting the Corrupted with his sword one at a time. A weapon that could kill hundreds of them would be a massive boon. But the risk that the weapon could kill Cryaliss as well was too much.

“I’ll do it,” Cryaliss said. “This is too big of a chance for us to pass up.”

Ulrin couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Are you so determined to sacrifice yourself? You’ll take every opportunity!”

Cryaliss seemed taken aback by his outburst. Her eyes went to the floor, unable to meet his. “It’s not like that. But this might be the only way you can accomplish your goal. You’ve told me the royal palace is completely filled with Corrupted. With this, we could get past them so that you can finally kill the creature your father has become.”

“Looking to take down the old king, eh?” Bayliff said, breaking the silence that had formed between Cryaliss and Ulrin. “Retake the royal palace. Yes, a fine objective. Both symbolic and practical, as the palace would serve as a perfect staging ground for operations within the kingdom. I approve.”

“Wasn’t really looking for your approval,” Ulrin grumbled, his attention still on Cryaliss.

“And yet, how lucky you are to receive it nonetheless because I can assist you with your mission.” Bayliff closed the door to the head librarian’s room and started to lead them back downstairs. “If you’re going to reach the palace, you’ll need a way across the drawbridge. And I happen to know that an artifact that can remotely lower the drawbridge from the far side is kept in The Vault, the royal family’s secret treasury of ancient heirlooms.”

Now Ulrin’s attention was on Bayliff. “How do you know about that place? Only members of the royal family and the Masters are supposed to be trusted with it. I was never even told where it was because I had not reached the age to be trusted with it.”

“I’ve had some time with the records kept by the Master of Students.” Bayliff gestured to one of the many stacks of books that littered the floor. “Perhaps if you are trying to keep something a secret, don’t write it down. Anyway, I know exactly where The Vault is located, and I could take you to it. There’s only one complication.”

“Of course there is.”

“We need a key to access The Vault,” Bayliff continued. “One that is kept in the Master of Students’ office. Which is in the main administration building.”

“That’s where I sensed that powerful presence,” Cryaliss reminded Ulrin.

“Indeed,” Bayliff said. “The former Master of Students, Jeffries, likes to linger around that building. He was Bludded before The Bleeding and has thus become an incredibly powerful Corrupted. And to make matters worse, there’s always a swarm of creatures surrounding the area. I actually theorize the weaker Corrupted are drawn in by the strong, but it’s something I’ve never been able to prove. Either way, we’d never be able to get into the office, get the key, and come out alive. Unless . . .”

“Unless Cryaliss used the Pentahedron,” Ulrin reasoned.

“You get what you want, a stepping stone on your journey to slay the king and retake the palace. I get what I want, a chance to see my theories about the Pentahedron put to the test. What do you say?”

Ulrin clenched his fists. Never before in his life had he wanted to strike someone as he did right now. The scholar’s arrogant attitude had him on his last nerve.

But again, he couldn’t deny that Bayliff was right. This was the best chance he was going to have. And ultimately, the decision was not up to him.

“Cryaliss. I . . . I can’t make this decision for you,” Ulrin said. “You know I would never ask someone to risk giving up their life for mine.”

“You don’t need to ask,” Cryaliss responded, her voice firmer now. “I want to do this. I need to do this. All this time, I have been looking for what my purpose is, why I’m still alive, how I can help. And this feels like it’s it.”

Ulrin nodded. “Very well. We have a deal, Bayliff. But if you try anything funny, I will run you through with my sword.”

“Noted. I’ll need some time to gather my things, and we should also discuss strategy and tactics before we set out. Oh, I’m excited. This has been a long time coming. I look forward to our work together.”

At least one of us is, Ulrin thought.`,

      title: "Chapter 20",
      content: `Cryaliss fiddled with the strange device in her hands. It was surprisingly heavy despite its small size, though her attention was called from its weight when she sensed the BludSeed inside. It pulsed in rhythm like a heartbeat, each beat sending forth a wave of fierce heat that threatened to singe her just for being close. It was intense, an inferno compared to those she had worked with back at the temple. There was something purer about it, but also, she sensed, angry.

It was as if the BludSeed had a will of its own, one that rejected the very notion of being linked to her. It hated her, despised her very presence, and promised to destroy her if she dared to try to reach out to it. It was as if all the ones she had worked with before had their spirits broken long ago while this one was still ready to put up a fight.

She had acted confident when she volunteered to use the Pentahedron despite its risks. Bayliff had explained its design and inner workings to her, and no part of it sounded beyond her capabilities. But now she wasn’t so sure. What if the will of the BludSeed was too much for her to overcome?

There wouldn’t be any way to find out until the moment came. She’d get her chance soon, as the three of them neared the main administration building. And toward danger she hoped she could defeat.

Bayliff seemed to know every path, passageway, and tunnel on the campus. Combined with Cryaliss’s ability to feel the presence and general direction of the Corrupted, they were able to weave a path that avoided the lurking hordes. However, that safety would not last long. As they neared the main administration building, Cryaliss could again feel that overwhelming powerful presence. It was all she could do to hide how much she was shaking so as not to draw the concern of Ulrin.

The building itself proved to be a narrow, three-story structure. A single row of windows along the second floor was covered up from the inside. Any distinguishing features of the architecture had long been lost to the layers of black sludge that coated the roof and walls.

Ulrin stopped suddenly, drawing his sword with one hand while holding out his other to signal them to stop. Almost immediately, the sounds of growling and howling began to fill the air around them.

“We’re surrounded,” Ulrin declared.

Cryaliss looked around, but she couldn’t see the creatures. They must have been hiding in the darkness outside the illuminations of their lanterns. “I can’t sense them. The presence in the building is too strong; it drowns out everything else.”

“Maybe we should turn back,” Ulrin suggested. “Find a defensible position to hole up into and lure them to us.”

Bayliff scratched his chin. “How unusual. It’s unlike the Corrupted to stalk in these numbers. With this many gathered around, the most aggressive should already be charging at us, which should cause the others to follow suit.”

“Don’t give them any ideas,” Ulrin said.

That frightening presence grew stronger, closer. Cryaliss gestured to the building. “They’re waiting for it.”

The front door slammed open, and a deafening roar boomed from inside. The Corrupted that surrounded them howled and screamed in response.

Cryaliss peered into the darkened doorway but could not make out anything beyond the threshold.

“It would appear as though Master Jeffries is inviting us inside,” Bayliff said.

“Well, let’s not keep the Master waiting, then,” Ulrin said. “You ready, Cryaliss?”

Her hands clasped tighter around the Pentahedron. The beating within seemed to grow stronger. “Yes.” She hoped she was not lying.

Ulrin nodded and led the way into the building. They could hear the Corrupted around them shuffle about excitedly, but none of them came out from hiding to pursue them.

Inside, they were met with a single, long hall with doors lined on either side. The doors bore plaques that declared things such as “Admission Office” and “Student Complaints.” The doors and walls were clean and in good repair, strangely so compared to the state of the rest of the campus. The same could not be said for the floor, which was covered in streaks of dried blood. All the blood trails led down the hall to a pair of double doors.

“OOOOH . . . I KNOW THAT . . . SMELL.”

The voice was deep and gravelly. It echoed through the hall, making it seem as though it could be coming from anywhere.

“Keep close,” Ulrin said as he crept forward.

“PRINCE ULRIN . . . YOU ARE MANY YEARS . . . LATE FOR YOUR EDUCATION . . . HAVE YOU COME TO PICK . . . YOUR SPECIALTY?”

The words were clear, but the pronunciations were strained, like each syllable was foreign to the speaker, who was only mirroring something they had heard.

“Is that the Corrupted speaking?” Cryaliss asked, trying to keep her voice from trembling. “How is that possible?”

“That’s our former Master of Students, all right,” Bayliff confirmed. “Master Jeffries. Now one mean Corrupted.”

“Remember what Gerevin said back at the temple,” Ulrin said. “The Corrupted still maintain some semblance of who they once were, buried beneath the layers of insanity. I didn’t want to believe it, but it seems he was telling the truth.”

“Indeed,” Bayliff added. “I’ve noticed the occasional odd bits of behavior that led me to the same conclusion. Corrupted that linger around the places they once lived and worked. Sometimes they pick up tools or books that belonged to them in the past, often just to destroy them, but the connection is there. And it would seem as though Master Jeffries, as a more powerful Corrupted, has maintained his ability of speech. But don’t listen to anything that it has to say. His mind has become completely twisted.”

“TWISTED . . . NO . . . IF ANYTHING . . . I HAVE BEEN UNCOILED . . . COME AND SEE . . .”

“Is it right for us to kill him if, if he’s still, well . . . sentient?” Even as Cryaliss said those words, she realized she was more concerned with whether they even could kill that creature. This close, its presence was overwhelming.

“KILL ME?”

Laughter filled the hall. Harsh, uncontrolled laughter that morphed into howls before fading back to silence.

“YES . . . COME . . . KILL ME . . . I AM WAITING . . .”

Ulrin was steely-faced. “We can’t turn back, not with that horde behind us. There’s no choice but to go ahead. Be ready with that device.”

Cryaliss nodded grimly. “Right.”

“I wouldn’t concern myself too much with the ethics of the situation,” Bayliff said as they neared the door at the end of the hall. “I was personally witness to the former master slaughtering my former colleagues and his own students. For that crime alone, I’d say he’s earned whatever justice is coming to him.”

They finally reached the door, which bore a plaque that read “Master of Students,” though the title had been scratched through.

Ulrin approached the door with his sword in front of him, then carefully reached out for the handle.

The door came flying open, nearly smacking Ulrin in the process. More wild laughter boomed from beyond.

“Guess that’s his way of inviting us in,” Ulrin said.

The three of them hesitated a bit, nerves caused by what lay ahead locking their feet.

They were forced to action when, through the entrance of the building, there came the terrible clamor of dozens of Corrupted barging their way in behind them.

“Looks like they got tired of waiting,” Bayliff said. “Let’s hurry.”

Inside Jeffries’s office, they found what could only be described as a mass grave. Bodies were stacked up in all corners of the room. They were torn apart and disfigured enough that it was impossible to get an idea of the number, but based on the size of the pile, there must have been dozens of them.

Cryaliss’s stomach churned at the sight. Such senseless slaughter. No matter how many times she saw it, she would never get used to it.

One of the piles shifted, and a head popped out from the middle of the bodies. It was of an older man, stern-looking but thin, perhaps even feeble.

“THERE YOU ARE . . . PRINCE ULRIN . . . THE GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT . . . OF THE ROYAL FAMILY . . . HOW I WAITED FOR MY CHANCE TO DISCIPLINE YOU . . . TOO LATE NOW . . . FAR TOO LATE . . .”

Though the voice seemed to be coming from the old man, his lips did not move.

Ulrin pointed his sword at the creature’s exposed head. “Master Jeffries. It’s been a while. I apologize for missing my enrollment. I got pretty busy, what with the apocalypse and all.”

“STILL NO MANNERS . . . NO MATTER . . . I AM NO LONGER A TEACHER . . . I AM A PREDATOR . . . AND YOU ARE PREY . . . FOR MY FINAL LESSON . . . I SHALL SHOW YOU WHAT THAT MEANS . . .”

The bodies began to fall away from the pile as the Jeffries-creature rose, and they got their first good look at it. That frail human head was atop a massive, bulbous body, segmented in two like an insect’s. Six vicious claws sprang forth from its bottom segment, each dripping a strange liquid that sizzled as it hit the ground. In the middle of the top segment, a disturbingly long tongue dropped out of a giant mouth, and as the mouth opened and howled, it became clear that this had been the source of the voice all along.

“Now, Blood Maiden!” Bayliff shouted. “The Pentahedron!”

Cryaliss reached her senses into the Pentahedron and made contact with the BludSeed inside. The connection came easily to her, no different from the many times she had done so in the temple. She then did as Bayliff had instructed her and turned the bottom of the box while holding it toward the creature. There was a pull of power, like a magnet threatening to take the device from her hand. She held on tight and focused her senses. Threads began to appear to her, much like when she worked on a body. Many of them ran down the hall they had come from toward the Corrupted heading their way. A single, thick, twisting thread, more like a rope, connected the Pentahedron and Jeffries.

She twisted the bottom of the device once and forced her energy through it, directing it to target those strings. In a way, it was the opposite of what she did when she was healing a body, so though it was a new experience for her, the instinct came naturally.

The BludSeed refused to cooperate. That defiance she had sensed earlier flared, and the energy she put forth was redirected back into her. It felt as if fire shot through her veins, traveling up her arms and into her body. She was certain she was about to be burned to death from the inside. In shock and pain, she dropped the Pentahedron.

“Cryaliss!” Ulrin shouted, but he could not go to help her as the Jeffries-creature was upon him.

Her vision blurred, and the next thing she knew, she was on the ground. There was shouting, howling. The ground shook with the force of an incredible blast.

She forced herself back onto her hands and knees and tried to look around. Things were going badly. By the door, Bayliff was tossing his crafted firebombs at the approaching horde, but Cryaliss could tell that despite how many were getting caught in the blast, many more were still coming. On the other side, Ulrin was on the backfoot against the Jeffries-creature. It was surprisingly quick, and its claws had greater reach than his sword. He was already covered in cuts from near grazes, each one sizzling from that dripping venom, and was getting quickly backed into a corner.

Steeling her resolve, Cryaliss grabbed the Pentahedron and struggled back to her feet. She didn’t know what she could do differently to get the BludSeed to accept her, but there was no time to think. Ulrin was counting on her. She had to get the device to work, no matter what.

Cryaliss restored her connection to the BludSeed and again felt the threads that connected the device to the Corrupted. She gritted her teeth and attempted to force her energy into those threads once more. The BludSeed refused, and fire swelled through her veins. This time, she refused to let go. She screamed in pain and clenched her hands tighter on the device. Even if she was to burn to death, she’d finish what she started first.

Jeffries lunged forward and slammed Ulrin with its upper body. Ulrin slammed hard into the wall and dropped to his knees. The creature loomed over him, ready to deliver the finishing strike.

The BludSeed pulsed and radiated intense anger. Cryaliss matched its anger with her own, a righteous rage at the BludSeed’s refusal to allow her to help her friend. With a roar, she forced yet more energy into the device.

The BludSeed relented. A wave of energy was released across the threads and toward the Corrupted.

Bayliff had retreated from the door as a wave of Corrupted flooded inside. They did not make it far before their bodies froze in place and began to twitch violently. Cryaliss could feel the energy tear through them, turning the Blud within them that had granted their power back against them. They were literally torn apart from the inside.

They began to fall, but Jeffries still stood. He howled in pain and rage as the Blud twisted in his body, but he refused to go down. His mutations had made him so strong that even his insides being shredded could not stop him. With another howl, it struggled mightily toward Ulrin, raising a claw to finish him off.

Cryaliss forced more energy into that thread. The device bucked in her hands, trying to pull itself away. It was a struggle to maintain her grip, and her energy drained away. Bayliff had not exaggerated the toll the Pentahedron would take on her body. Already she was feeling her knees shake to support her, her arms felt heavy, and her breathing labored. But she pressed on.

The thread flared brighter as more energy pulsed across it. Jeffries spun wildly, clutching his head, its howls becoming more and more inhuman.

Just a little more, Cryaliss thought, though she wasn’t sure if she had any more to give.

Ulrin jumped back to his feet, seizing the opportunity granted by the Jeffries-creature’s pain. He rushed forward and, with one smooth motion, shoved his sword into the creature’s human face. Silverlight blazed brightly when it pierced through its flesh, and the room briefly became as bright as if the sun was shining directly into it.

The thread snapped as the life of the Jeffries-creature was extinguished. And not a moment too soon, as Cryaliss realized that she was not able to keep standing any longer. She collapsed, her vision fading. As her consciousness faded, she hoped she had at least proven to be useful.

---

“Cryaliss!” The voice was urgent but could barely be heard through the void. “Cryaliss, wake up! Don’t be dead!”

“It’s not safe to linger here.” Another voice could be faintly heard. “More will be coming soon.”

“Damn it, I’m not leaving her!”

“Be logical. We all knew the risks.”

“Say one more word, and I will cut you down! I’m not leaving her.”

Cryaliss slowly returned to consciousness and saw Ulrin leaning over her. He looked so sad. She reached out a trembling hand and wiped a tear from his cheek.

“You shouldn’t waste tears,” she whispered.

He looked shocked. “Cryaliss! You’re alive!”

Bayliff reached down and picked up the Pentahedron. “Interesting. The drain on her energy was as bad as my worst-case scenario assumptions. You finishing off Jeffries with your blade probably saved her life by severing her link with the creature before the last bit of her life was consumed.”

Ulrin’s lips curled up in a snarl at Bayliff. Cryaliss was worried that he might attack the scholar, and she wanted to say something to ease the tension, but she found she didn’t have the energy to speak any further.

“I’ve got you,” Ulrin said as he lifted her onto his shoulders.

“I found the key to The Vault,” Bayliff said. “But it seems it will be some time before she’s ready for travel. Let’s head back to the library to recuperate.”

Ulrin growled some obscenities under his breath but agreed. He began to carry her back toward the library, but she could not keep her eyes open for the entire trip. She drifted off, trusting she was safe with Ulrin.`,

      content: `It did indeed take several weeks for Cryaliss to recover. Fortunately, the library was fairly secure and well stocked with supplies, so camping there wasn’t much of a risk until she got better. On the less fortunate side, the company could have been better. The longer Ulrin spent with Bayliff, the more he disliked the man.

He was useful, sure. Right after the battle with Jeffries, Ulrin’s arms were burning from the injuries he had withstood. Bayliff had been able to quickly study the toxin from Jeffries’s claws and devise an antidote. He’d also brewed some tonics to help with Cryaliss’s recovery. And there was no question that he was remarkably knowledgeable, perhaps even smarter than Gerevin.

But Ulrin didn’t know how much more of the scholar’s attitude he could take. He alternated from not talking for days at a time while deep in his books to rambling about his theories nonstop. Yet it was his lack of concern for the lives of people that bothered Ulrin the most. He acted as if lives didn’t matter if it meant testing one of his theories. They’d barely been back for a day when he started bringing up having Cryaliss do another test with the Pentahedron, even though it had nearly killed her. Ulrin had shot that idea down quickly.

Although he didn’t think Cryaliss had dropped the idea of using the device again despite his protests. She insisted they would bring it with them “just in case,” but by the look on her face, it seemed she was ready to sacrifice herself at a moment’s notice. Ulrin didn’t know how to talk her out of it, and she changed the subject whenever he brought it up.

The time finally came for them to take their journey back into the Heartlands and to The Vault. Ulrin had hoped to convince Bayliff to just give him the location and remain behind, but Bayliff was insistent that he would be needed to identify the drawbridge artifact, as well as any other treasures in The Vault that might help their mission. Ulrin suspected he just wanted to be around Cryaliss if she used the Pentahedron again. So it was with some reluctance that he ensured they were supplied for a third person before they departed.

At the very least, Ulrin was able to get some satisfaction in providing one surprise that had caught Bayliff off-guard. While Bayliff wouldn’t tell him the exact location of The Vault, Ulrin was able to convince him to tell him some landmarks nearby. Using that information, he was able to set the Pathfinder to show them the safest path. Fascinated, Bayliff requested a chance to study the artifact, and Ulrin took petty pleasure in denying him.

With the Pathfinder’s aid, they were able to navigate a safe path from the University, down the mountain paths, and back into the Heartlands. From there, it was just a short trip south along the edge of the mountain range to reach the landmark. Ulrin had expected the pudgy scholar to struggle down the mountain and complain about it, but while Bayliff was a bit slower and tired faster, he never once mentioned the pace. Ulrin had to give some begrudging respect for that.

From the landmark, they had to go by Bayliff’s directions since he still refused to give exact coordinates. They came to camp in a cave Bayliff claimed was roughly half a day’s walk from The Vault to rest and discuss their final approach.

“I’d expect we will run into quite a few Corrupted as we get close,” Bayliff explained. “There were several garrisons stationed nearby, and the road was a popular trade route. Plenty of people to get turned, as you would expect in the Heartlands.”

“We’re pretty far from the border,” Ulrin commented. “Wonder why there was a need for such a large military presence. Did this trade route require so much protection?”

Bayliff shrugged. “You’d have to ask someone in the army’s chain of command if you could find one still alive. Maybe it was to provide extra protection to The Vault, even if the soldiers themselves didn’t know it was here. All I know is what it means for us, and that’s a lot of bodies to turn into Corrupted.”

It could be even worse than that, Ulrin thought. The few garrisons he had braved getting close to during his travels had usually been surrounded by thick hordes of former civilians who had been trying to reach the army when all the chaos started. But he didn’t want to add that bleak outlook to their already dangerous situation.

“We’ll need to be stealthy then,” Ulrin said. “Last thing we want is to bring an entire horde down on our heads. The Vault itself should be safe since it’s hidden away. We just need to get by without getting spotted.”

“I should scout the way ahead of the two of you,” Cryaliss suggested. “Try to sense the number and locations of the Corrupted.”

Ulrin had long had different plans, though he had not been looking forward to telling her. “Actually, Cryaliss, I’d like you to stay behind this time. Watch over our camp here, and we will regroup with you once we have what we came for.”

Cryaliss, understandably, looked shocked and hurt. “What? Why?”

“We can move quicker and faster the fewer we are and the lighter we travel,” he explained, though he knew she wasn’t likely to believe him. “I’d prefer to go just on my own, but I, unfortunately, do require Bayliff for this. You can remain here and watch over our supplies.”

“But I’m the only one who can sense the Corrupted,” Cryaliss countered.

Ulrin had already played out the entire argument in his head and knew how he would respond. “We will be traveling mostly through an open area. The Corrupted shouldn’t have anywhere to sneak up on us from. And as long as we’re careful, we should notice them long before they notice us.”

“But I can . . . I should . . .” Cryaliss stammered, trying to come up with an argument.

He decided to just lay it on the table instead of tiptoeing around it anymore. “You can sacrifice yourself with the Pentahedron. That’s what you’re meaning to say, isn’t it?”

She wouldn’t meet his eyes. “Well, if it becomes necessary. What if you become surrounded, or trapped, or . . .”

“Why are you so determined to sacrifice yourself?” His tone was harsh. “Even before you got that artifact, you were already too willing to give up your own life to save others. To save me. Are you ready to die and just looking for an excuse?”

Cryaliss retreated into herself, bringing her knees close to her chest and wrapping her arms around them. “No, it’s not that. It’s just my duty as a Blood Maiden.”

“Hmmm.” Bayliff scratched at his chin. “I read a book on the responsibilities of the Maidens while conducting my research. I don’t recall seeing anything like that. Were my books outdated?” Ulrin gave him a severe look, to which Bayliff shrugged. “Of course, none of my business. You two continue your heart-to-heart.”

“I promise, it’s not as if I want to die,” Cryaliss said. “It’s just that if it comes down to a choice between my life, your life, or the life of someone else I could save, I would not choose myself.”

It hurt Ulrin to hear the shaky timber in her voice, but he needed to press on. “Does your life have so little value to you?”

Cryaliss, surprisingly, did not deny it. “Maybe. How does one measure the value of their life? Should I value my life so highly? Should I keep living on while others, more honorable, more innocent, meet their end? Is it right for me to believe that I am that important?”

“You’re important to me!” Ulrin blurted it out unintentionally instead of the rehearsed lines he had prepared for the argument.

She looked at him with wide eyes, and Ulrin realized what he had said. He opened his mouth to follow up the statement with some kind of clarification to ease the awkwardness, but nothing came out. Cryaliss also seemed speechless, and an uncomfortable silence followed.

“This is why I hate being around people,” Bayliff muttered, breaking the silence.

Cryaliss tugged at the sleeve of her robe. “I’m sorry, Ulrin. I didn’t . . . I don’t deserve to be cared about by you so much.”

“What did you do, Cryaliss?” They had already come this far, Ulrin decided. “You’ve carried around this burden of guilt since I first met you, and you once said you were responsible for the deaths of your sisters. I’ve tried not to press you on it, let you have your secrets. But when you say you believe those that are more innocent than you deserve life more . . .” He stumbled on his words, not sure how he wanted to phrase it. “If your past is why you are so ready to throw your life away, then the only way I can ever understand it is to hear it.”

“I can leave for this, if you need,” Bayliff chimed in.

Cryaliss shook her head. “No, it’s okay. If you’re also going to be traveling with us, it’s fair for you to know who I really am.”

She rose to her feet, took a deep breath, and began, “My family was impoverished, and a poor crop yield in the region had made the price of food too high. My siblings and I were at risk of starving. So, my parents decided to sell me to the temple. I was terrified but happy to do it if it meant my siblings would live a happier life. The amount they paid for me was a lot, too, and I worked hard to make sure I was worth the price. I studied, trained, cleaned, whatever was expected of me to the best of my ability. But even though one of the core tenets you are taught is that your old life is dead and you should treat any memories from before you joined the temple as if they belonged to a different person, I would often think about my family. I felt guilty about it, breaking the doctrine so frequently, but I couldn’t help thinking about my siblings and my parents and wondering if they were okay and if I would ever have a chance to see them again.

“When The Bleeding happened, the temple became a sanctuary for survivors. New refugees would come across The Maiden’s Path every day, and we did our best to shelter them. But we were getting too crowded, our supplies too strained. The Matrons thought their work was too important to risk it being interrupted by the temple running out of food and water. We were instructed to begin expelling the refugees the next time there was sunlight.

“It was then, by fate or fortune, that my family arrived. I recognized them immediately, even though they did not recognize me. My parents, my siblings . . . I was so happy to see they had all survived. I hadn’t seen them for years, but I still loved them dearly. Perhaps even more than my sisters in the temple, as much as that shames me. But as soon as they arrived, they were about to be expelled with the rest of the refugees. I couldn’t let that happen.

“So, I snuck out of the temple and walked the paths to the nearest town. It was so foolish. Me, barely more than a child, out in that hellscape, trying to find enough food and water for all those refugees so that they could remain at the temple without endangering supplies. I don’t know why I thought I could even carry that much if I could find it. But then, what seemed like a miracle happened. I found a handcart loaded with supplies. The town seemed deserted, or at least, that’s what I told myself to justify taking the cart without looking for its owner.

“I brought it back to the temple and was scolded by the Matrons for my disobedience. But they agreed to bring in the cart, anyway. There was enough food and water to keep the refugees alive for a couple of weeks if we rationed it carefully. It wasn’t much, but it was a start, and we were all still hoping that the Matrons would have the solution for The Bleeding soon. So, we allowed the survivors to stay and distributed supplies to them from the cart. I arrogantly felt as though destiny had chosen me to save my family.

“But that was far from the case. We didn’t know at the time how careful you had to be. Some of the packs on the cart must have been breached by the rain. Soon as we fed the refugees, they all started turning into Corrupted. We tried to get control of the situation by exiling those who were showing symptoms from the temple, but they were scared and resisted us. And then, it seemed, all at once, our temple was filled with creatures. We were overwhelmed, and my sisters were slaughtered.

“The Matrons told us to retreat upstairs, but I went to look for my family instead. I was hoping that they had somehow both not been turned and not been torn apart by the other creatures yet. But when I found them, they had already become Corrupted. They chased me, and somehow, I was able to slip away and flee the temple.

“I somehow survived. My sisters, they all died. I could sense it from the temple that even the Matrons who had sealed themselves on the highest level had met their end, which we confirmed during our trip there.

“It was all my fault. I was the one who put my family ahead of my sisters. I defied my instructions and brought in tainted food that turned the refugees into monsters that slayed us. I survived when they all died because I selfishly went to go look for my family instead of sticking with my sisters. When you consider all that, it’s clear that I don’t deserve to still be alive. That I still live . . . it’s aberrant.

“The only thing that allows my living to make sense is dedicating this sinful life to helping others, trying to find some use that justifies my survival. And if I need to die in order to find that justification, well, it doesn’t bother me because I should already be dead.”

Ulrin sat quietly and listened attentively to Cryaliss’s story. When she finished, he sat in silence for a bit, digesting what she had said. It felt as if pieces of a puzzle had come into place, and he felt foolish for not having been able to put it all together sooner.

“I am sorry,” he said finally. “I knew your tale must have been a rough one, but I did not know it cut so deep. It must have been terrible to carry all that weight on your own this whole time. But I cannot agree with your conclusion. You made mistakes, but out of love, not malice. That does not take away your right to live here and now.”

“How can it not?!” Cryaliss near shouted, louder than Ulrin had ever heard her raise her voice. “How can you not see the imbalance of it, the unfairness? How can you not agree that I should have died there that day with my sisters?”

“I cannot agree,” Ulrin repeated. “I cannot because that would mean agreeing that my own life is undeserved, and I, too, should seek the means of its end.”

“What?” Cryaliss’s voice dipped back to its usual softness. “No, I didn’t mean . . . It wasn’t my intention to make you feel guilty. I know you lost a lot, too. To have your father turn and take your family and home from you must have been awful. But you hardly bear the blame for any of it.”

“I bear as much blame for my survival as you do yours,” Ulrin responded. “Though it pains me to speak of it, since you shared with me your past, I will share with you mine. If only to show you that your survival is not so unique in this new world.”

“On the day of The Bleeding, I was meant to be with my family in the throne room,” he began. “It was supposed to be the day of my ceremony, when I would receive the gift of Blud and take my place as a true heir to the Emberlind dynasty. Nobles from all over the kingdom had come to witness the ceremony, only to find out that it had been delayed at the last moment. Somehow, the Blud I was to receive had vanished. For me, this was a disappointment and an inconvenience. For my father, however, he smelled a plot. He ordered all of us to go to the throne room for our protection while matters were sorted.

“I chose to pretend that I had not received the message and instead do what I usually did when I was feeling down and engage in some sword practice. Because I had decided to goof off, I was not there when the king turned. My siblings and my mother were.

“When the chaos started, no one really knew what was happening. I was fortunate enough to be in the company of the royal Swordmaster, Solden, who had been sent to fetch me. Thanks mostly to his talent, we were able to survive the initial madness as members of the household turned, and the castle itself was set aflame. We did not know what had become of my family at the time, but I assumed, or really just hoped, the security of the throne room would have protected them. It was made to withstand sieges from dragons, after all. Surely, it could hold out against this.

“Master Solden did not agree. He advised that our wisest course was to retreat from the castle for now and await reinforcements and reasoned that if my family was indeed still alive, then to trust that my father and elder brother would see them through this situation. But I refused to run. I was rash and headstrong and demanded we make for the throne room. I ordered him as his prince. I had not given Master Solden an order in my life before. He was my sword teacher and mentor and my friend. In many ways, I considered myself closer to him than my own father. Yet here I refused his advice and ordered him down a dangerous route to find my family, whom I insisted must still be alive.

“Of course, I was proven wrong. After traversing the floors of the castle at great risk to us both and nearly meeting our end more than once in the process, we finally reached the throne room to discover a gruesome scene. My younger siblings’ bodies had been charred beyond recognition; I could only tell it was them by the glow of the signet rings that remained on their charred fingers. My mother lay with her neck broken. The corpses of our retainers lay in tattered pieces. And my father . . .

“He appeared above us all of a sudden, drifting down from the ruins of the roof on wings made of bone and sinew. His form was twisted and frightening, yet it was unmistakably him. Solden and I attempted to make our escape, but Solden was caught in the spew of flames my father had spit from his mouth. I managed to drag him out of there and put him out, but the fire had already left him burned and disfigured.

“Solden was changed after that. He blamed me for his pain and mutilation and voiced such, and I couldn’t help but agree with him. I tried to make it right by caring for him as he recovered, but it was too late. As soon as Solden had the strength to lift his sword once more, he came for me. If he had waited a little longer, been a little stronger, that probably would have been the end of me. I could never have hoped to take the Swordmaster in a proper fight. But he was still weak and slow, so to defend my own life, I cut him down. He was my friend and mentor, but I slayed him.

“Then I fled the castle on my own, leaving any who might have still been alive to fend for themselves and have not been back since.

“So, you see, by your logic, there were many times when it would have been ‘right’ for me to die. If I had gone to the throne room like I had been ordered, I would have been killed with my family. Had Solden not been with me, I would have died with the rest of the castle’s occupants during the chaos. My selfish demands to seek my family in the throne room instead of fleeing caused Solden great harm, and yet I killed him to save myself.

“But there is nothing I can gain by wallowing in those memories. They haunt me in my dreams, but while I am awake, I need to press on. Whether I deserve to be alive is a moot point because I am alive, and so long as I live, I must keep moving toward my goal.”

Ulrin breathed out as he finished, glad to be done with trudging up old memories. He was sweating, and his hands were trembling. It was bad enough to relive those days whenever he closed his eyes, but to face it consciously was far worse.

Cryaliss’s eyes were downcast. “I had no idea. Perhaps you do understand my plight better than I thought. I have frequently been impressed by you, Ulrin, and your resolve in the face of terror and despair. But now I find myself amazed. That you can overcome such tragedy . . . I just don’t know if I’m as strong as you are.”

“It’s not that impressive, really. I just focus on my goal and use that to drive me forward.”

“Your goal of avenging yourself upon your father.” She became contemplative for a moment. “Tell me then, Ulrin. If that mission is the central driving force of your life, then if your moment came, if you realized that in order to succeed, you needed to sacrifice yourself, would you?”

Ulrin thought through the question. He realized the logic trap he was walking into, yet he could not bring himself to be deceptive to her. “Yes. Without hesitation.”

“So, if my goal, the thing that gives me the strength to go on, was to aid you, then is it any different that I would sacrifice myself for the cause?”

He had to admit she had him good there and made him look like a major hypocrite in the process. “Fair enough. I cannot argue that it is your right to pursue your goal with whatever power is available to you. But if you are to aid me in that way, do it when it matters. The castle will undoubtedly provide our greatest challenge, and if ever there was likely to be a time when we would be left with no choice but to turn to the power of the Pentahedron, it would be there. But not here, not like this. This is just a steppingstone on our path. For now, please, listen to my request: Remain here and allow me to handle The Vault.”

She didn’t seem happy with the offer but nodded. “Very well. I suppose that is a fair compromise. But you better come back alive.”

“Of course I will.”

Their eyes met, and they lingered there for a while, and Ulrin felt a connection strengthened. He wouldn’t have imagined that he would have ever met someone he felt comfortable enough with to share so much, but with her, it somehow came easy.

Bayliff coughed, reminding Ulrin that he was still there. He had the awkward realization that he had just divulged all of that personal history to him as well.

“What?” Bayliff asked as both Ulrin and Cryaliss turned to look at him. “Oh, don’t expect any tragic story about survival from me. I know why I am still alive: because of my genius. I am clever and resourceful enough to make it through situations others cannot, and I feel no shame about it.”

With that, the tension in the air was broken, and Ulrin could not help but chuckle slightly at the absurdity of Bayliff’s attitude.

“I don’t know what you find so amusing,” Bayliff said. “No matter. If you’re all done sharing personal anecdotes, we should try to get some rest. You and I are in for one difficult hike tomorrow, Ulrin, so you better be ready for it.”`,

      title: "Chapter 22",
      content: `“You notice it too?” Bayliff asked.

“Yeah.” Ulrin held his lantern higher, dangerously high for what was supposed to be a stealthy endeavor, yet it made no difference. “There’s not a single one of them in sight.”

“Maybe they are stalking us,” Bayliff posited. “But that doesn’t feel right either, does it? You’d think we would have had some indication of them by now.”

“I don’t think that’s it. If it was just a few, maybe. But for an area that is supposed to be as populated as this, we should have definitely spotted some by now.”

Ulrin and Bayliff’s hike to The Vault had thus far been uneventful, something that could be viewed as a blessing, but for some reason, it left them both uneasy. They had expected this to be a high-stakes challenge of their ability to move and navigate quietly, spot Corrupted before they were spotted, and find the right paths that would keep them safe. But thus far, such stealth had proven unnecessary. The whole region was quiet and still. There was something more disturbing about it being deserted than if it was crawling with Corrupted.

“Could the region have been evacuated?” Ulrin asked. “Maybe the soldiers at the nearby garrisons thought to gather the civilians and travel to a safer area?”

“You still wouldn’t expect it to be this empty,” Bayliff responded. “They’d need to be fleeing from something, after all. Besides, there isn’t really any safer place nearby for them to go unless they were going to try to march an entire file of scared and confused civilians up the mountains.”

“Then it may be something new. Keep your eyes open.”

“You needn’t worry. I am the height of observation.”

“I’m sure.”

They soon got their answers.

The road ahead of them was littered with the corpses of Corrupted. Dismantled and strewn apart in such a chaotic mess, it would be impossible to count the number of them if they had wanted, but it was clear there were hundreds. Shreds of military uniforms, soaked in tainted blood, covered flayed torsos. They had found their missing soldiers.

Ulrin had seen this kind of thing once before. It couldn’t be.

With no further thought, he rushed ahead, trusting that the trail of bodies would lead him to his destination. He could hear Bayliff calling out for him from behind, but he could not slow down. The pudgy researcher would just have to catch up.

He was panting by the time he reached it. The building was nondescript, something that would not stand out in the middle of a medium-sized town, and certainly not what one would expect from a secret vault that held the treasures of the royal family. But while visually bland and unnoteworthy during normal conditions, these were anything but. The strength of its construction was made evident by its surroundings, which must have been caught up in a blaze at some point in the recent past based on the ash that had yet to settle.

The single door was sealed tight, to Ulrin’s frustration. There was no apparent locking mechanism. Perhaps he had been wrong. Or maybe he was too late.

Bayliff finally caught up, breathing heavily and looking annoyed. “What is your problem? You see something that can do that to the Corrupted, and your reaction is to rush toward it?”

“I’ve seen that kind of carnage once before,” Ulrin explained. “It was done by my brother, Gerevin.”

“The heir? Yes, he was a Bludded. He would have become a powerful Corrupted like Master Jeffries. But it’s unusual for them to slay their own.”

“He’s different somehow,” Ulrin said. “He’s powerful like a Corrupted, but he’s not mutated and seems to still be in full control of his mind. Well, his personality has changed, and he was . . . unfriendly the last time we met, but he’s still intelligent and talkative. Certainly not the monster we saw with Jeffries. He was working toward his own goal but did not specify what that was.”

“Fascinating. My mind would boggle at the possibilities if I were able to study him. Hmm . . . though sounds like he would not be equitable to that.”

“I’ll be sure to ask him next time I see him.”

Bayliff approached the door and studied it. “You may get your chance soon. Someone has been through here recently. The ash has been disturbed around the lock.”

Ulrin squinted but saw nothing. “What lock?”

With a sigh, Bayliff took out the key from Master Jeffries’s office and placed it against the door. The key began to give off a slight glow, and there came the sound of gears grinding from beyond the door. This was followed by a click and the door opening.

“It’s an enchanted lock, of course,” Bayliff said matter-of-factly. “You didn’t think the royals would trust their precious treasures with mundane security? Well, come on. Let’s not keep your brother waiting.”

The insides looked more like a library than a treasury. Shelves filled with thick tomes lined the walls. Here and there, displays were set up, reminding Ulrin of the exhibits in the museum. But they were all currently empty.

“Someone’s been busy,” Bayliff said, looking at one such display. “Oh, I do hope your brother has not departed yet. If he takes off with every artifact before I’ve even had a chance to look at them, I will be quite peeved.”

They continued until they reached the last room, and there, just as Ulrin had thought, hoped, and feared, was his older brother.

Gerevin had open in front of him a massive sack, from the opening of which came various strange lights and sounds. Ulrin reasoned that he now knew what had happened to the artifacts from the empty displays.

“Bringing an outsider into the royal vault, Ulrin? I believed even you knew better.” Gerevin’s face didn’t show the slightest bit of warmth at seeing his brother again.

“I think we’re a little past royal protocol,” Ulrin said. “What are you doing here, Gerevin? It looks like you’re looting the place.”

“As heir to the throne, all The Vault’s contents by right belong to me, and I can do with them what I wish. It is not looting, but reclaiming.”

“Oh? And what does the ‘heir to the throne’ intend to do with all those artifacts?”

“Safeguard them from fools,” Gerevin replied while fixing his gaze on Ulrin. “Idiots who would die trying to use them in idealistic but pointless pursuits and leave them lost in their grave.”

“Well, since I’m the only other surviving member of the royal family, it’s hard not to take some offense to that.” Ulrin’s hand clutched the hilt of Silverlight. “Don’t suppose I could convince you to leave one or two of those objects for this idealistic fool? They could very well mean the difference between life and death for me on my mission.”

Gerevin waved his hand dismissively. “You may have your pick of whatever I deem unworthy of bringing with me. Until then, sit quietly and don’t get in my way.”

Ulrin fumed. He couldn’t believe his brother would dismiss him so callously. But he also remembered how powerful Gerevin was, how easily he was able to dispatch Ulrin when they last met. What could he hope to do against that kind of power?

Bayliff scratched at his chin. “Prince Gerevin. I read many of your papers back at the University. You always impressed me as one who stood a head above his peers. I have to say, it is disappointing to see you in this state.”

That finally provoked a flash of emotion across Gerevin’s otherwise controlled features, the quickest moment of anger. “Is that so? And what state is that?”

“One in which your abilities to use logic and reason have been impaired by your struggle against the Corruption.” Bayliff spoke matter-of-factly, which, in Ulrin’s opinion, was more aggravating than if he had taken a mocking tone. “I don’t know what method you used to maintain your sanity against the working of the Blud inside you, though I’d be fascinated to learn about it. But clearly, whatever it is, it’s imperfect. It is taking a percent of your concentration to keep yourself controlled. But that leaves less of your mental capacity for thought and action.”

“You believe you have deduced so much from observing me for a minute?”

Gerevin stepped menacingly toward Bayliff, causing Ulrin to wonder if he should try to silence the scholar before he provoked his brother any further. But the fact that he was getting any kind of reaction out of Gerevin at all was piquing his interest. Just how close was Bayliff to the truth?

“It is actually the juxtaposition of the carnage outside and your current behavior that led me to this conclusion,” Bayliff explained. “The Corrupted were not just slain, but torn apart, butchered with the fury of a wild animal. Yet here, your movements are slow, careful, and controlled. From your expression to your tone to the way you step, it’s all too intentional. How do these two aspects of a single person fit together? The only way that makes sense is that the aggressive nature of the Blud is indeed working beneath the surface, but you keep it just barely in check. Except when you need to unleash it, of course.”

“Do you want to test your theory?” Gerevin asked. “See what happens if I let go of my control?”

Ulrin surprised himself by stepping forward, facing the creature his brother had become. “He’s right. You’ve lost yourself. Why else would you insist on being so antagonistic to me, your own brother? Why shouldn’t we be able to work together? You’re not making sense, and you’re certainly not acting like the brother I knew.”

Gerevin fixed him with a cold stare that caused him to step back. “I see it is not enough that you expect me to tolerate you running about as you wish, playing the hero as if you had just stepped out of one of those fairy tales our grandmother liked to prattle on about, or that you defy me when I advise you to hide and survive. But you also expect me to temper your questions and expectations. You think my time is best spent serving your selfish and short-sighted ambitions instead of the grand work only I can accomplish?”

“And what is this ‘grand work?’” Ulrin shot back, forcing himself to stand his ground even though his instincts told him he should retreat further away. “What are you doing besides hoarding knowledge and artifacts and being a complete asshole?”

His brother stopped just a foot in front of him and looked down at him, accentuating their height difference. “I am undoing it all. The legacy of our people. When I am done, there will be naught but ash to remember us by. And perhaps I have delayed overly long with eliminating the part of our bloodline right in front of me.”

The threat caused Ulrin to react more by instinct than intention. Silverlight was in his hands in a flash and was slashing the air in front of him. Gerevin had moved so quickly that, to Ulrin’s perception, he had practically vanished.

A feeling of guilt welled up inside as Ulrin realized what he had just done, mixed with a shimmer of relief that he had missed. That was quickly replaced with panic as he realized he had lost track of his powerful, unstable brother.

He didn’t have time to reflect on it for long, though, as he felt a cold hand rest on his shoulder.

“I see we are in agreement for once,” Gerevin’s chillingly calm voice said from behind him. “Let us settle this between us.”

Ulrin twisted, pulling himself out of Gerevin’s grasp, and tried to bring his sword around in a backswing. Before his sword got halfway through its arc, he was suddenly lifted off his feet. Things happened so fast that Ulrin’s mind had to race to piece together what had happened. Gerevin had reached out, grabbed him by the collar, and tossed Ulrin straight into the air in a single jerking motion.

An impact against a hard surface against his back, and Ulrin realized that he had hit the ceiling. As he started to powerlessly be pulled by gravity back toward the ground, he saw Gerevin leap from a standing position up toward him. He grabbed Ulrin by the throat and slammed him forward, pushing him back against the ceiling.

Impossibly, Gerevin ran across the ceiling as if gravity had no impact on him. He held Ulrin by the throat and dragged him along. Even with the protection of his cloak and gambeson, Ulrin could feel the grinding of the stone against his back. But his biggest concern was the hand around his throat that was cutting off his ability to breathe.

He had somehow managed to keep his grip on Silverlight throughout all of this, and he flailed it in his brother’s direction. He couldn’t hope to swing it properly in his position, but he hoped the sharpness of the blade would allow it to pierce something, even with no force behind it. With some luck, it grazed Gerevin’s arm.

It didn’t pierce him deeply, just a shallow cut below the shoulder, but it was apparently enough for Gerevin to let out a grunt of pain and release Ulrin from his grasp before leaping off the ceiling back toward the ground.

Ulrin took a grateful breath of air into his lungs, but he couldn’t enjoy his minor victory for long as he was once again left at the mercy of gravity. He came crashing unceremoniously down, only being saved from hitting the hard floor directly by landing atop a table that splintered from the impact. Not that it was much better, and Ulrin found himself dazed and racked with pain.

Pure adrenaline forced him back to focus, as he couldn’t afford to be lying around in a life-or-death battle. He forced himself to his feet, despite his body’s protests, and brought Silverlight into position in front of him.

Gerevin stood patiently on the other side of the room. Smoke drifted from his arm wound, though he didn’t seem to pay attention to it. The damage gave Ulrin a sliver of hope, though. It seemed that, whatever Gerevin had become, he was enough of a monster for Silverlight’s enchantments. If he could just land one solid strike, maybe he could win this.

“You should have stayed down,” Gerevin goaded. “I might have walked away without checking if you were still alive.”

“This is the most brotherly bonding we’ve had in years,” Ulrin retorted. “I’m not going to miss out.”

Ulrin slowly approached, keeping his sword upright and ready to strike at the slightest twitch that his brother made. Gerevin stood still, not seemingly concerned by the sword inching ever closer to him.

There was a flash of sudden motion, too fast for Ulrin’s eyes to follow, but he was prepared for it now. He knew it was pointless even to try to match Gerevin’s speed, but if he could react preemptively, he might have a shot. Diving into a roll, he felt a powerful and rapid force strike the air above him. He quickly sprang back to his feet and broke into a dash. He ran only a few feet before his instinct told him to break off to the right. He spun his sword about as he did, striking at the space he had just been in.

A hard jerking of the sword as Gerevin appeared to materialize in the space before him, and for a moment, Ulrin felt triumph as he was sure Silverlight had struck Gerevin dead-on. That faded as he realized the blade tip had been stopped an inch from Gerevin’s body. His brother had a hand on the sword’s crossguard and kept it locked there with a grip of steel.

“Clever,” Gerevin said. “But sloppy. Master Solden would have landed that strike.”

Before Ulrin could respond, Gerevin struck out with his other hand, hitting Ulrin with an open palm across his ear and the back of his head. Ulrin was staggered by the most intense ringing he could imagine. The world seemed to split in two, both halves spinning on an axis made of blinding light. He stumbled, trying to find some bearing. He knew he was defenseless, with him barely being able to make out where Gerevin was, much less what he was doing. His sword was freed, at the very least, but all he could do was take some wild swings in front of him. He awaited the finishing strike from his brother.

But as his vision came back into focus and the ringing died down to a dull roar, he saw that Gerevin was simply standing there as if he was waiting for him.

“Is this the best a prince of the Emberlind dynasty can muster?” Gerevin asked. “Look at yourself, flailing about like a wounded animal. It embarrasses me. Either fight like a man worthy of your titles or lay down your arms and die with dignity. Do you want your last moments to be so undignified?”

Spurred on by his brother’s mocking, Ulrin charged at Gerevin at full force, bringing his sword high for a strike toward the neck. Gerevin bent his body back, bending so quickly and at such an angle that it looked like it should have broken in two, but he showed no sign of even mild discomfort as the sword went over him.

At least until Silverlight suddenly began to glow brightly. For a moment, the room was lit up as if the sun had just broken through the roof. Gerevin’s composure broke, and he let out a howl as he shielded his eyes from the blinding light.

The sword’s light flickered out after just a second, but that was enough. Gerevin stumbled back, covering his eyes with one hand, clearly disoriented. Now was Ulrin’s chance. He rushed forward and struck.

Though he was blinded, Gerevin somehow still sensed his approach and ducked out of the way, though not enough to avoid the full swing, and Silverlight left a mark across his chest. One more step forward, and Ulrin prepared his finishing strike.

Gerevin let out an inhuman howl and sprang away, avoiding the sword. He darted around the room on all fours like a beast, howling and growling. Then he came charging back at Ulrin. Ulrin raised his sword to strike, but Gerevin’s speed was impossible to match. Gerevin grabbed him by the shoulders and roughly tackled him to the ground.

Ulrin couldn’t quite make out what happened in those next moments. At some point, Silverlight was torn from his grip and tossed across the room. Gerevin was atop him, pinning him to the ground and beating him. Blows landed on his chest, gut, and face, drawing blood and eliciting grunts of pain. Gerevin’s face was twisted up with mad rage. Ulrin was completely powerless to do anything as his brother was beating him to death.

Gerevin raised his hand as if ready to make one last blow, a finishing strike. With his strength, he could crush Ulrin’s skull or tear his head clean off. Ulrin wondered if he’d be as dismembered as the Corrupted outside.

Their eyes locked. Gerevin hesitated.

“Okay, that’s quite enough,” Bayliff’s voice called out. “I would recommend you release Ulrin if you don’t want to become charcoal, Prince Gerevin.”

Gerevin looked over at Bayliff but did not move. “You think you can command me?”

Bayliff held up one of his firebombs. “You’re a well-read man, prince. Certainly, you know what this is. While you were having your brotherly spat, I went ahead and planted these throughout the room. I toss this, and the whole place goes up in Irimian fire. It doesn’t matter how tough you’ve become; you won’t survive.”

“You’ll kill yourself, too.”

The scholar shrugged. “My greatest work is in safe hands, miles from here. Dying here would be inconvenient, but not tragic, if it means ending such a dangerous creature.”

They glared at each other in silence for a while, the only sounds coming from Ulrin’s gasping breaths.

Finally, Gerevin stood, releasing his grip on Ulrin. His calm returned, and he walked over toward his bag of pilfered artifacts, sealed it across the top, and lifted it.

“You are fortunate to have made such a wise ally, Ulrin,” Gerevin remarked as he walked to the door. “But this is the last time I’ll let you be a distraction. I’m going to go put an end to this, once and for all. If your desire to play hero gets in my way again, I will kill you next time. Once again, I advise you to live out the rest of your days in hiding and leave any fantasies of grandeur in the past.”

This time, Ulrin couldn’t be sure he was wrong.`,

      content: `“I can’t believe he would do this to you.” Cryaliss looked over Ulrin’s injuries carefully, despite his insistence that they were not as bad as they looked. “I should have been there. Maybe the Pentahedron would have worked on him.”

“Or maybe it wouldn’t have, and you just would have made him mad for trying.” Ulrin sighed. “I shouldn’t have antagonized him. I knew how strong he was. Or, I thought I did. I should have just played into his ego and stayed out of his way until he left. It was stupid of me to try to take him on.”

“You were just defending yourself.”

“No.” Ulrin shook his head. “I struck first. Or tried to, anyway. I just . . . the things he was saying, the threats . . . they got to me.”

Cryaliss gave him a concerned look but didn’t say anything further as she finished looking over his injuries. Ulrin had already given himself a self-examination while Bayliff had returned to the cave to fetch Cryaliss and bring her to The Vault and came to the conclusion that his wounds were all superficial, but he was pretty bruised up, so he could understand her concern. He must have looked awful.

Bayliff returned from one of the back rooms. “I hate to add to our list of problems, but it seems that the device we came here for was among those that Gerevin looted. We’re not going to be able to open the castle drawbridge remotely.”

“Of course he did,” Ulrin replied with a deep exhale. “Gerevin seems to have known exactly what I’m planning and where I’m going this entire time, and for some reason, he’s been adamant about me quitting. Says that I’m getting in his way. Makes sense that he would know just what I was here for and take it to keep it from me.”

“It’s this kind of sibling rivalry that makes me glad to be an only child,” Bayliff said. “Now we’ll need to figure out what our next move is without it.”

“No, we don’t.” Ulrin’s voice was defeated. “Gerevin was right. I see that now. There’s no point in any of what I’m doing.”

Cryaliss flinched as if she had been struck. “You don’t mean that, Ulrin.”

“I do. I don’t know what I was thinking. I can’t defeat the monster that my father has become. All these years searching for solutions, and what have I to show for it? A sword that I can’t swing fast enough, and a box that requires sacrificing my closest companion. Even if we could get into the palace, we’d just be killed. And all for what? Some dream of avenging my family? What a pathetic notion. No, Gerevin was right. This building is secure. There will be plenty of supplies to salvage from the nearby garrisons. We should fortify ourselves here and wait out the end.”

It was as if all the air had suddenly been sucked out of the room. Ulrin could feel the disappointed eyes of his companions boring into him. He couldn’t blame them. There was no one more disappointed in him than himself.

Bayliff scoffed. “Well, I, for one, can’t just keep moping about. My talents are destined for greater things. I’m going to search this place for anything useful Gerevin didn’t steal. You are free to do as you wish.”

He disappeared, leaving Ulrin and Cryaliss alone. An awkward tension filled the air between them. Outside, the Blood Rain had begun to fall, and its pitter-patter on the roof echoed through the room.

“Ulrin . . .” Cryaliss began.

“I won’t blame you if you feel the need to leave,” Ulrin replied. “I know you have your own goals. You’re looking to help people. But I don’t think I can be helped any further. I don’t expect you to stay here with me.”

The words burned as he spoke them. The very thought of her leaving him filled him with unfamiliar anxiety. He pushed it down. It would be selfish for him to demand she set aside her goals for his failures.

“I wouldn’t leave you,” she responded without a moment’s hesitation. “Even if you chose to give up everything and remain here, I would stay here with you. But I don’t think you will. You’ve worked too hard and come too far just to let one defeat make you stop.”

“It’s not just one defeat!” Ulrin felt like he needed her to understand. “It’s that I’ve finally been given a look at what I’m truly against. When I ran from my father, the monster that father had become, I barely got a look at him. I knew he was more powerful than the other Corrupted I’d faced, but seeing Gerevin and what he’s capable of, I realize how badly I’ve underestimated the power of the Bludded. It was horrible.”

Cryaliss gave him a sympathetic look. “It must have been hard seeing your brother like that. Bayliff told me how he behaved when he lost control.”

Ulrin looked at the ground. “Of all people, I can’t believe Gerevin ended up like that. I know that’s silly. We’ve seen time and again that it doesn’t matter what a person was like before. Once the Corruption gets them, they are completely gone. But it still feels wrong. Like Gerevin should be an exception. But there’s no question after seeing him like that. He’s not.”

“It sounds like you really looked up to him.”

“He was the perfect brother, the perfect prince, the shining example of our family. I was always being compared to him, with one example after another telling me how I should be more like him. It was bothersome at times, and the expectations sometimes caused my rebellious nature to surface. But I never held it against him. He spent a lot of time with me when I was a kid, playing games and tutoring me. There were times I felt alone in the castle. Master Solden and my grandmother were there for me when I needed them, but I had no one my own age to confide in besides my brother. He was my closest friend until he started to become a recluse in the months before The Bleeding.”

“He changed before the Corruption?”

He thought back to that time. “Yes, but it was different from the way he is now. He hadn’t become agitated and confrontational. But he had secluded himself in the castle’s laboratories, and no one in the family saw much of him. Looking back on it, I wonder if he had some indication of what was coming.”

Cryaliss looked thoughtful. “If so, maybe that’s how he’s managed to keep himself from losing his mind. If he knew The Bleeding was coming, he might have worked out some way to counter it, at least for himself.”

“You didn’t see him crawling around on all fours and pouncing on me like an animal. I wouldn’t say it worked out.”

“I wonder.”

Ulrin noted a tone in her voice. He knew her well enough by now to recognize that she had something more to say but was afraid to say it. “What are you thinking?”

“As you said, I didn’t see what you saw, so maybe I am wrong, but . . .” She paused. “Gerevin’s so strong that he can tear Corrupted apart with his bare hands. Yet he beats you in a fury and only leaves you with superficial bruising. You would think with that force, you would have been pulverized. We’ve both seen what a Corrupted’s strength can do to a person, and Gerevin is even stronger. So why aren’t you dead, or at least hurt far worse? The only explanation I can think of is that he was holding back.”

Ulrin felt one of the bruises on his face. It was true. Any one of those strikes should have been enough to cave his skull in. So why was he so lightly injured? He had been so consumed with grief and self-pity that something so obvious slipped right by him.

“And then, in the middle of this feral rage, he suddenly stops because Bayliff makes a threat?” Cryaliss continued. “No, I think your brother was more in control than you give him credit for, and he still cares for you too much to seriously harm you.”

“But if that’s the case, what was this all about?” Ulrin’s mind was reeling. “Why taunt me, fight me, if he was just going to hold back from harming me?”

“You’d have to ask him yourself. Though who knows where he went off to and when you will run into him again?”

It came to Ulrin quickly. “That part I do have an answer to. He took the artifact to the drawbridge and warned me to stay out of his way. I’d say it’s pretty clear he intends to go back to the castle.”

“Do you think he’s after the same thing as you? Killing your father?”

“Maybe. He did say something about undoing the legacy of our family. Perhaps that’s what he meant. If so, we’re going to need to hurry to catch up to him.”

Cryaliss brightened considerably. “So, you won’t give up?”

“Not yet. If Gerevin is looking to kill the king, then this will be our best chance. Gerevin is strong. He might not even need our help, but damn if he isn’t going to get it, anyway. And this time, I’ll get some answers from him. He won’t be able to slip away by antagonizing me into a fight again.”

Ulrin felt as if a fire had been relit in him. Part of it was that he was nearing the end of his journey. Years of struggle would all finally lead him to a confrontation with his father, and he would either succeed, or he would fall.

But there was something else under it all: hope. Hope that his brother was still in there, somewhere, under the layers of arrogance and hostility that he had built around himself. That the Blud inside him did not have control and that maybe some of their brotherly bond remained. It was wishful thinking, perhaps, but that glimmer of hope filled Ulrin with more motivation than he had felt in a long time.

“I’m glad the two of you seem to have got that sorted,” Bayliff said as he reappeared. He held a small pile of shimmering objects. “I was afraid it would take you much longer to reach those conclusions. I’ve managed to find a few useful trinkets that Gerevin passed up. These small metal plates can be sewn into your clothes to give them the strength of metal armor without the weight. And this amulet provides its wearer with a degree of resilience against heat and fire. Just how much is unclear; it seems it was designed to assist in forges and not with the intention of withstanding dragon fire, but given what you’ve said about the king’s abilities, I would say it is better than nothing.”

“Good finds,” Ulrin said as he looked over the trinkets. “At least our trip was not a total loss. Was that all that was left?”

“There were a few more objects of interesting origin and function that I would love to study given a chance,” Bayliff replied. “But nothing that would directly benefit our mission. Perhaps one day in the future, I will return to study them.”

“Then let’s set the Pathfinder. We have no time to waste if we want to keep up with him.”

Next stop, the royal castle.`,

      content: `That place.

The king of hunters glared at the charred ground, his attention so focused it was as if he thought he could destroy it just with his stare.

It always resurfaced when he passed by that place. It started as a tingle at the back of his head, spread down his back, and assaulted his heart. Why, he did not know.

The king had no place left in his perfect body for weakness. He had long ago cleansed himself of all of it. His body, mind, and soul were all honed, sharpened, and purified to make him the perfect hunter. And he had proven, both the mortals and his fellow hunters, that this was the case. He had earned his position as king, unlike the weaklings who had come before him.

The living incarnation of power, a god made flesh, the King of Lorn and of the Blud, the successor of both dragon and man. And he would tear the beating hearts out of any creature that dared vie for one of those titles.

And yet, in that place, it wavered ever so slightly. Why?

It was the place where he had rid himself of one of his weaknesses. Where he had hunted and slain the brood of his mortal life. Burned them alive. Though their remains had long since been claimed by the others, the ground was still charred from its exposure to the heat.

They were weak, and not just because they were small. Because they were soft flesh and scared. And disobedient.

Oh, so disobedient! Perhaps if they hadn’t run, perhaps if they had listened, he would have let them taste the blessed rain and take new form. They would not match his power, of course, but they would have had some place in this new world of the strong.

He felt so regretful at having to kill them. It was necessary. But it would have been better if he had not needed to.

It was that line of thought that caused it! He had to stop it. It was a weakness to think of the past. The weakness of a pitiful mortal man who thought himself king just because other mortals had told him thus. He was no longer that man. He had ascended.

He was no longer that man. Even if he could still sometimes hear that man in the back of his mind. Screaming at him. The screams were normally deafened by the roar of blood and fire coursing through him. But when he was here, the screams could be heard anew.

Screams and sobs. Weak. So weak. Perhaps there was even more he needed to expel. To ascend from perfect to more perfect.

For now, he left that place. On wings molded of his glorious flesh, he ascended through a gap in the ceiling, out into the night. The blessed rain was falling.

He let it wash over him. Purify him. Cleanse him of any taint. Make him more divine.

They were out there. He could sense them, distant but drawing closer. The surviving members of his mortal life’s brood. They were coming to hunt the hunter. Foolish.

One had the blessing. The true blessing, not shallow mimicry granted by the rain. If he bent the knee to the king, he might be tolerated to live. But he wouldn’t. Those with strength do not yield it to others. He would test his might against the king. And he would die for it.

The other he could not sense as clearly, for he lacked any blessing at all. That any mortals at all still remained was insanity. Infuriating. Like a rat infestation—just when you think you have dealt with them all, you find more in your larder.

He might not even get a chance to kill them himself. His sons. The other hunters he had allowed to continue living in his castle would get to go first. But it would be satisfying to hunt them himself. Maybe he could burn them in that same spot as the others.

When he had enough of the rain, he descended back into the throne room. There, he found another who had made himself at home.

It was a bloated thing. The shredded remains of mortal attire clung tight to its bulbous form. He could sense power radiating from it. It had been feasting. Engorging itself until its form could not take even one more ounce of the blessing without bursting. The sheer force it emanated made it a higher-tier hunter than the rest of the rabble. And it thought to use this power to make a play for the throne.

Unforgivable.

It roared at him, its voice shaking the room. He roared back, shaking the castle.

The usurper rushed at him. It raised its claw and struck him. He grabbed the claw mid-strike, twisted, and pulled it until it came clean off the traitor’s body. Then he turned it around and drove it into his assailant’s skull, impaling it with its own claw.

It cried out in pain, but he did not stop. There would be no mercy. He tore every limb from its body and then pierced it through its bloated torso.

Only when the creature was limbless, pathetically wiggling on the ground as it bled out, did he grant his subject the mercy of death with a mighty bellow of flames.

One less traitor. One less threat to his glorious kingdom.

All glory to Lorn.

Long live the king.`,

      content: `It had been a long time since Gerevin had last laid eyes on the castle. Back in another lifetime, when he could still have considered himself human.

He had not wanted to come back here. Some memories were best left buried. And there was little to be accomplished. His research was pointing him beyond the borders of the kingdom. Nothing remained in the castle that was of any practical value.

Yet Ulrin seemed fixated on it and was growing more confident and impatient by the day. Emboldened by those new companions, perhaps. It wouldn’t be long before Ulrin attempted to enter the castle himself as part of his mission to slay their father. Gerevin’s attempts to dissuade him had been unsuccessful. He had always been stubborn.

This left Gerevin with little choice. If he didn’t slay the king himself, Ulrin would certainly arrive and get himself killed. In truth, Gerevin wasn’t sure if he would be strong enough, either. Vangress’s form was stranger and more powerful than he had seen in any other Corrupted, even among the Bludded. There was the real possibility he would lose his life here as well. If that were to happen, he at least needed to find a way to take the king out with him. He couldn’t let Ulrin face him.

He licked his lips, tasting the metallic blood from his most recent treatment. It should be enough to keep him in control for a while longer, though it was getting harder and harder to gauge the exact amounts necessary, especially when he was put under strain. Ulrin’s little trick with the blinding sword had nearly cost him. Gerevin had only regained control in time to pull his punches. A moment later and his brother would have been dead.

All the more reason he needed to be done with this before Ulrin caught up. They had to keep apart. Their bond of blood made it hard for Gerevin to control himself when they were close, and Ulrin’s prodding only made it worse. It had been a risk to reveal himself at all. For so long, he had been content to simply aid Ulrin from the shadows when their paths neared. But as Ulrin grew more reckless, he had hoped to convince him to take a safer path. He was afraid he had only made things worse.

Gerevin pulled the silvery artifact from his pack, which was shaped like a key for a tumbler lock. He held it out over the gap between where he stood and the castle until the key turned from silver to gold, indicating it had been linked with the opposing mechanism on the other side. Then he turned the key as if he was unlocking an invisible door.

There was a rumbling and a creaking as the drawbridge mechanisms that had not been used in five years sprang to life. The drawbridge lowered slowly and with occasional jerks as the uncared-for chains got momentarily caught, but eventually finished its descent and settled into its proper place.

The first of the Corrupted came rushing across the drawbridge before it had even finished its drop, drawn by the loud noise and movement. They were momentarily confused as they came to the end and didn’t see any immediate prey. Gerevin’s Blud had always baffled them, at least for a bit. It was similar to theirs but different, and they did not know what to make of it.

They got their answer as Gerevin grabbed the closest Corrupted and tore its head off. There came a collective shriek as they now knew what this strange figure in front of them was: an enemy.

Dozens of the castle’s former residents came charging across the drawbridge toward Gerevin, their forms twisted and grotesque. They bore claws, fangs, tendrils, stingers, and things that Gerevin did not have words for. Individually, they posed little threat to him, but in large enough numbers, he risked being surrounded and overwhelmed. So, he allowed them to file across the drawbridge and dealt with them as they came within his reach, ceding ground as needed to keep the horde centered in front of him.

His conscious mind was slower than his speed, so he allowed his reflexes to do much of the work for him. His body twisted out of the way as a stinger like that of a massive scorpion whipped by. He reached up and grabbed the stinger and, with one twist, tore it from the body it had once belonged to. A set of eight spidery claws came at him all at once, and Gerevin ducked between and smashed in the skull of the creature they belonged to with his fist. A bladed edge, not unlike a sword, came in low toward his legs. He jumped high over, then planted his knee in the body of the twirling creature, sending it flying off the bridge and down the cliff side.

One after another, Gerevin dispatched the creatures. Some he tore apart. Others he sent falling to their deaths down the chasm. He formed a pocket of death amidst the horde, and he began to revel in the feel of it.

Yes. Kill. I am the hunter. I will kill them all!

He had to pull himself from that mindset before it was too late. Too much of it, and he could lose control. It was always the risk he took when he allowed his body to react on its own. The Blud that fueled that amazing power and speed also fueled his rage and bloodlust. If he ever went over the tipping point, he didn’t think there would be any going back.

Gerevin became more aware and deliberate with his movements. It was tougher to dispatch the rest of the creatures this way, but he was still superior. He chose to rely more on the chasm, grabbing the creatures as they came close and tossing them mightily from the bridge. A few caught themselves on the sides and tried to crawl back up, but they were met with his boot crunching into their face.

Finally, he reached the other side of the bridge. No more of the creatures stood in front of him. He had either killed all the ones that had arrived, or the ones that remained now recognized him as the superior hunter. Didn’t matter which. The castle was now open to him.

As he entered the castle, he triggered the drawbridge mechanism one more time to put it back into its raised state. Just in case Ulrin was closer behind than he thought, that should keep him out until he was done here.

Once inside, he decided to take the most direct route to the throne room, up the spiraling staircases to the keep. Much of this area had been destroyed by the flames that had consumed the palace, so he had to leap between sections of the stairwell that were no longer intact. Fortunately, ascending this way made it unlikely any Corrupted could follow him.

He reached the top and stepped into the keep.

There was a blast, and the ground suddenly gave in below him. At first, he thought the fire damage had weakened the floor, and he had accidentally stepped on a delicate spot, but further blasts revealed them to be intentional detonations of some kind of explosive. He twisted in the air to avoid debris that threatened to fall on him, then righted himself so that he would fall vertically. The walls were too far from him to grab on and stop his descent. All he could do was fall until he hit the bottom.

Hit the bottom, he did. Even with his enhanced strength and durability, pain shot up his ankles and legs as he landed. It was a long fall. Based on how long he had been falling, he must have dropped all the way into one of the sub-levels of the castle. Chunks of stone blown loose from the blasts landed beside him.

He looked around and tried to get a bearing on where he had wound up. It was an unfamiliar area of the castle. It was an expansive chamber, large enough that he might have reasoned he had wound up in a cave beneath the castle if not for the metalwork that ran along the walls. Bars made of black metal created a grid-like pattern across the stone. A single door made of the same black metal sat at the end of the room. Otherwise, it was bare.

It gave him the impression of a prison cell but for something much larger than a person. Whatever it was, he needed to get out.

Those additional blasts had sealed the hole in the ceiling that he had fallen through, so it looked like he wasn’t getting out the way he came. That left the door.

He approached it, gave it a test, and found it sealed. No matter for someone with his strength. He pushed, pitting his might against the door. To his surprise, the door did not so much as budge. After some time of being unsuccessful in pushing it open, he switched the pounding on the door with his fists and with kicks. Nothing he did so much as put a dent in it.

“I wouldn’t waste my energy,” a voice called out from the other side of the door. “This holding cell was designed to imprison a dragon. There’s nothing you could hope to do to escape.”

A narrow slot appeared near the top of the door, a sliding metal piece that blended with the rest of the metal so well that Gerevin hadn’t noticed it until it was slid open from the other side. The face that appeared through it was badly burned and scarred, but Gerevin could still make out the distinct features of the royal Swordmaster.

“Master Solden! What is the meaning of this? Release me at once!”

“My apologies, Prince Gerevin. You are not the one that the trap was intended to catch.” His voice was harsh and gruff, with none of the lightheartedness of the Swordmaster that Gerevin once knew. “Nonetheless, I’m afraid I can’t let you leave. Your family is to blame for much pain and suffering. Even if you were unaware or uninvolved, you still bear part of the blame as part of that bloodline. It is fitting that you be left here to rot for your family’s crimes.”

Gerevin pounded on the door again. “Solden! Don’t you dare do this! I command you to release me!”

“I’m afraid I am well past the point of taking orders from your family. That ended the day the king set me on fire. You can try to command one of your other servants, but I’m afraid most of them are not in that much of a talkative mood these days.”

Gerevin had no response to that but to slam the door futilely once more.

Solden shook his head. “Goodbye, for now, Prince Gerevin. I will be back to check on you, don’t you worry. I wouldn’t want to miss the moment of your demise.”

The slot was slid back into place, leaving Gerevin alone.

This was a problem. Not just because he was stuck, but because he was stuck without any of his treatments at hand. He had a limited amount of time before his sanity started to wane, and the Blud took control. If he did not find a way out of here before then, he would become another Corrupted.

And if he was right, and Ulrin was on his way . . .

He needed to find a way out and fast.`,

      content: `Thanks to the magic of the Pathfinder, they were able to make good time to the capital without encountering any major dangers. They avoided the city itself, which they could tell even from a distance was more densely crowded with Corrupted than any place they had ever seen before. Instead, they kept a wide berth, circling around the river that surrounded the city and following an old footpath up the cliff sides toward the castle.

The drawbridge was up, preventing them from reaching the castle itself. The bodies of recently slain Corrupted informed them that Gerevin had already made his way across.

“He could have at least left the drawbridge down for us,” Ulrin muttered. “Now he’s just being petty.”

“How did you escape the palace for the first time?” Cryaliss inquired. “Is there another way in and out?”

“Not really. There’s an area in the lower sub-levels where the sewage from the castle is drained into the river below. If you’re careful, you can leap down. Hit the river like a brick from the length of the fall, but it’s survivable. No way back up, though.”

Cryaliss peered over the edge. “It’s a long way down.”

Ulrin peeked over himself and agreed. This high up, the river below was only barely visible. “I forgot how deep this ran. Amazing what five years away will do to your memory. I was thinking we might scale it, but that’s clearly not possible. We could gather rope until we have enough to reach the other side of the gap, but I’m not sure what we could use to toss it that far.”

Bayliff scratched at his chin as he observed the surroundings. “I may have a solution, but it could be an unpleasant one.”

“How unpleasant?” Ulrin asked.

“You recall your entrance into the University?”

How could Ulrin not? “You mean when you laid a trap for us that nearly got us killed by a horde of Corrupted?”

“Yes, that one,” Bayliff said without a hint of remorse in his voice. “I’m imagining something of that extent.”

“And what is this plan?”

Bayliff gestured at one of the tall marble pillars that had once supported the livery of the Emberlinds, though said livery had long ago been lost, leaving the pillar bare. “This marble here is just long enough to cross the gap between here and the castle entrance. It will require some calculations, but if I set up one of my firebombs to go off at exactly the right angle, I should be able to get it to fall the way we need. Of course, the sound of the blast is going to attract every creature in the vicinity onto us, and I don’t expect our makeshift marble walkway to be particularly stable. We’ll have a dangerous time crossing.”

“You’re right. That is a very unpleasant solution.” Ulrin looked back across the gap, wondering if Gerevin was already confronting their father. There wasn’t much time. “Better than any other idea I have. Start doing your calculations. We’ll deal with whatever comes at us.”

Bayliff nodded and began to more closely examine the pillar, muttering numbers to himself under his breath.

“So, I guess this is it,” Cryaliss said, sidling up close to Ulrin. “I am ready for whatever comes. I mean, the Pentahedron . . .”

“I know.” Ulrin didn’t like thinking about it, but he knew it was coming. “Just don’t go throwing your life away unless it becomes absolutely necessary. Have some faith in Bayliff and me to fight the hordes as they come. But if it looks like we are about to become overwhelmed and outnumbered, then call upon the artifact’s magic. I’ll be relying on you.”

As he spoke those final words, she smiled at him. “Thank you. I’ll be relying on you as well.”

Ulrin suddenly felt very warm, and he found himself unable to look at Cryaliss directly, instead darting his eyes away. “Would you mind taking a quick circle of the area to see if your senses pick up anything? I’d hate for us to get blindsided from behind when this all starts.”

Cryaliss’s smile dropped, and she became more serious. “Oh, yes, of course. I’ll be right back.”

As Ulrin watched her go, he reminded himself that he had to stay focused on the mission and the task at hand. He wasn’t blind to what was happening. He had developed romantic feelings for the Blood Maiden.

Such dangerous and foolish emotions to have here at the end of the world. So much for not getting attached, though that had long been a lost cause. He wasn’t sure if it was her gentleness, or her drive, or just her constant presence at his side that had caused it. All he knew was that his feelings for her went well above that of a traveling companion.

And yet, though he valued her more than anything else that remained in this world, he couldn’t stop her from using the Pentahedron. It would have been unfair and an insult to the person she was. He had to let her do what she felt was important, even if it made him sick.

He found himself somewhat envying Bayliff. The scholar was unbearable sometimes, but he had a logical view of the world that allowed him to plan his most efficient moves. He wouldn’t be caught second-guessing himself during an important moment due to emotional turmoil.

Ulrin approached the scholar as he laid his explosives. “Are you ready for this?”

“I’m fairly confident in my calculation, though there are some unknown factors about the construction of this pillar,” Bayliff replied. “I’ve done my best to compensate for all possibilities, but we won’t know for sure until we detonate if I’m correct.”

“Not just that. I have faith in your ability. I mean, are you ready for what’s to come? This battle is going to be tough. Between the Corrupted, and my father, there’s no guarantee we’re going to make it out.”

“Few things in life are guaranteed. I’m not afraid to die in pursuit of my goals.”

“That’s surprisingly noble of you,” Ulrin said, impressed. “Though I should have guessed that about you from your threat to Gerevin.”

“Well, that was a bluff.”

“It was?!”

“Of course it was. I wouldn’t have risked the safety of all those valuable artifacts by setting that chamber on fire.”

Ulrin laughed. “That sounds more like you.”

Bayliff shrugged. “I am serious when I say I don’t fear death, though I will admit that I would be quite frustrated if I die before at least setting proper events into motion.” He stopped working for a moment to look at Ulrin. “A scientist never truly dies so long as their work continues to be used. Our contributions far outlive our physical bodies. But the current state of the world leaves one’s legacy in doubt. If there is no humanity remaining, whom does our work benefit? So, I refuse the notion that our time is at an end, that the world is over. My legacy shall be finding the path to humanity’s survival, whatever the cost. That is why I find this mission to be so important. Retaking this castle is a major step in humanity’s survival, even if you can only see it as part of your path to revenge.”

He spoke so matter-of-factly, so confidently, that Ulrin felt a sense of shame. He’d long ago given up any ideal of saving humanity, feeling as though that time had long passed and the best he could do was live for revenge. He had hardly even considered what he would do if he was successful and somehow survived, but certainly, it was foolish idealism to think he could make a difference against The Bleeding. Yet here was the most logic-minded person he had ever met, and he believed humanity could yet be saved. Had Ulrin given up too easily?

Some prince he made.

“Of course, few can accomplish what I can,” Bayliff said as he returned to his work, that familiar arrogant tone returning. “There’s nothing wrong with having your sights on a more achievable goal.”

“You know, you’re an arrogant bastard, Bayliff. But I am glad to have you on my side.”

“I know you are.”

Ulrin left Bayliff to finish his work and returned to the edge of the cliff. Across the gap, the castle loomed. In his mind, he remembered how it had been before: those white walls glistening in the sunlight, the imposing tower made of the blackest stone that seemed to overlook the whole kingdom, the spires that frequently bore banners or décor for the various holidays and celebrations. It was the grandest place in the whole world, in young Ulrin’s mind, at least, the likes of which no palace, museum, or mansion could rival.

Like the people of the kingdom, the castle now seemed a twisted mockery of itself. Fire had claimed large swaths of the roofs and spires. Those once-white walls were coated with black sludge that continued to drip down their sides. The tower still stood, but though it once seemed like a watchful guardian, it now served as an imposing reminder of what they faced.

Ulrin’s fists clenched. At his side, he could swear he could feel Silverlight pulsing in its sheath. It was as eager as he was.

The time had come.

He was home.`,

      content: `“It’s ready to go whenever you are,” Bayliff said as he rubbed some black powder from his hands onto a heavily stained cloth. “Just give me the word.”

Ulrin nodded, then looked to Cryaliss. “Keep close behind us and let me know if you sense anything beyond the expected.”

“Right.”

Silverlight was drawn into Ulrin’s hands, and he took confidence from the solid feel of its handle. That silvery pattern, like flowing liquid, seemed to move faster and more chaotically than ever before.

He took another moment to brace himself, then turned to Bayliff. “Alright. Do it.”

Bayliff walked off to the pillar, lit a fuse, then returned to the group. A moment later, a massive blast shook the ground so hard that Ulrin thought the cliffside might give in and send them into the gap. The ground withstood it, but as planned, the marble pillar began to crack and wobble.

“Now to see if the pillar falls at the right speed to not split in two when it lands,” Bayliff said.

“And what’s plan B if it doesn’t?”

“Don’t have one yet.”

There came further cracking sounds from the base of the pillar, followed by a snap, and slowly the pillar began to fall. It picked up speed as it dropped, and Ulrin’s heart sank at the thought of it falling too fast. The far end hit the castle side with a tremendous bang. Cracks formed along the length of the pillar, and on its underside, slabs of marble broke off and dropped into the chasm. But it seemed to remain intact enough for their purposes, at least for now. No guarantee of how long it would remain that way.

Howls and screams resounded from the castle. Their blast had not gone unnoticed. It would have been nice to test the durability of their makeshift bridge, but there was no time.

“Let’s go!” Ulrin commanded before leading the charge across the pillar.

The pillar was smooth, and when it shifted under Ulrin’s weight, he nearly slipped off. He corrected himself and tried to keep up his speed, hoping to get to the other side before the Corrupted showed. And another pressing need for speed soon showed itself: The cracks along the pillar were rapidly growing with each step Ulrin took.

“Hurry!” he shouted, sprinting as quickly as he could without slipping off.

A massive, bloated Corrupted, more round than tall, wearing tight, stretched, and stained noble clothing appeared at the end of the pillar. It outstretched big, greasy paws toward Ulrin while letting out a guttural choking sound. Without slowing, Ulrin cut Silverlight in a vertical arc, severing through the center of the hand and the arm behind it, bisecting it in two. The Corrupted choked out some more noises and tried to bring its other arms around to swat at Ulrin. It was too slow, and Ulrin drove Silverlight deep into its bloated chest. He kicked down at its legs to trip it into falling out of the way of their path.

Ulrin’s feet touched solid ground on the other side, and Bayliff came off the pillar right behind him. Cryaliss was just about across when the pillar finally gave way and, with the loudest snap yet, split in two and began falling into the chasm. Cryaliss slipped, and Ulrin watched in shock as it looked like she was about to go down with it.

Fortunately, Bayliff was quick. He grabbed her by the shoulder and pulled her forward onto the castle entrance.

Ulrin wanted to rush over to help, but his danger instinct warned him his attention was needed elsewhere. He brought Silverlight in front of him just in time to block a bladed arm that was coming for his throat. He followed the block by slicing low, cutting the legs out from the Corrupted in front of him.

No sooner had the creature fallen than three more had taken its place. Like their fallen fellow, they were covered in sharp blades that jutted from their arms, legs, chests, shoulders, and stomachs. They looked like a depiction of a tortured soul, tormented by having every inch of their skin penetrated by steel, though instead of being pierced, the steel was bursting from within their body. It seemed painful, and their anguished cries only reinforced that notion. Ulrin felt it was a mercy as he brought Silverlight between their blades and ended their unnatural lives.

More came, but Ulrin found himself in a strange state where the sword strokes were coming naturally, as if he knew where he needed to strike before the enemy even revealed itself to him. Maybe it was the thrill of being home, the vitality given to him from finally being at the end of his journey. Or perhaps he had not just imagined Silverlight’s eagerness, and the sword was guiding his hand. Possibly he was just worried that if he allowed himself to get overwhelmed, Cryaliss would sacrifice herself with the Pentahedron, and that was driving him to fight even harder to prevent that from happening. Likely some combination of the three.

Whatever it was, his sword flowed like water between, and he made rapid progress, cutting through the horde of Corrupted, eventually fighting his way into the castle proper.

Master Solden would be proud, he thought, quickly followed by a sense of guilt remembering the old Swordmaster.

He cut another creature down and was finally given some breathing room. The Corrupted filled the chamber in front of him. Some of them crawled across walls, using their long claws to dig into the stone. Others crouched low, like predators ready to pounce. More flexed and howled and screamed, pure rage filling the air. There were so many, and they were blocking the path forward.

“Move!” Bayliff shouted, shouldering past Ulrin.

He tossed one of his firebombs into the horde. There was a flash of light, and fire burst forth. Screams and yells filled the air as Corrupted had their limbs blown off or were lit on fire. More filled the space, and they began to charge. Bayliff tossed another firebomb, then another. Blasts rocked the castle, causing the old stone to shake. Parts of the ceiling began to fall upon them, and Ulrin rushed to cover Cryaliss from the falling debris.

The chamber was cleared of anything but scattered limbs and burning corpses, but from several hallways, they could see more of the creatures rushing toward them.

“Is there no end to them?” Cryaliss cried.

“I am impressed with how many people the royal castle supported,” Bayliff remarked.

“There were a lot of people here for a celebration in my honor,” Ulrin explained. “This wasn’t exactly what I had in mind, though. This way, we got to make for the throne room!”

Ulrin led them toward the central staircases, the Corrupted right on their heels. He hoped once they got into the keep, the Corrupted wouldn’t follow them, similar to how the Corrupted had been afraid of Jeffries.

Unfortunately, it seemed like they would have to find another way. As they reached the staircases, they found them completely destroyed. The ceiling had caved in, blocking their path. Smoke drifted up, and rubble shifted as it settled, indicating this was recent.

“Did Gerevin do this?” Ulrin wondered out loud.

Howls came from behind them.

“We have to go!” Bayliff shouted. “Is there another way?”

“The long way, through the sub-levels,” Ulrin replied. “This way.”

They sprinted together, but as they entered the next hall, Bayliff stopped. He placed two of his firebombs on either side of the hall and lit them, then rushed to catch up. The blasts collapsed the hallways completely, preventing any further pursuit.

“That should keep them off us for a while,” Bayliff said between gasping breaths.

“Also means there’s no way back,” Cryaliss noted. “Only way to go now is forward.”

Ulrin nodded. “Doesn’t matter. We’re not leaving till we’re done. Let’s go.”

Having survived their entry into the castle, Ulrin led the group down, deeper and deeper below.`,

      content: `Unlike the rest of the castle, this place hadn’t changed much. Which made sense. It was far enough from where the fires had burned to be protected and didn’t have any living quarters, barracks, or really any reason why the average castle guest would be down here. Other than the occasional patrol or the servants who came down here to bring food to Gerevin in the lab, it was often empty.

“An impressive bit of architecture,” Bayliff commented as they made their way through the tunnels. “Built directly into the rock and capable of supporting the weight of the castle structures above. As a man of the University, I know I should defend the campus’s dome as a great architectural achievement, but I’ve always been more impressed with practical applications.”

“I’d be happy to give you the full tour once we’re done here,” Ulrin chided. “Remember what we are here for.”

Bayliff sighed. “I suppose, growing up here, you must be quite used to the sights. But this is my first time. Forgive my tourist attitude.”

Ulrin was going to shoot back with another rebuke when he noticed Cryaliss had stopped suddenly and was no longer following them. Her attention was drawn elsewhere.

“Cryaliss, what is it?” Ulrin asked.

“Something feels very off but also familiar,” Cryaliss said. “In that direction?”

“Is it Gerevin?”

“Not strong enough of a presence, but it’s definitely something I’ve felt before.” She started off in the direction she had motioned.

“Hey, wait!” Ulrin called after her. “That’s the wrong way!”

She didn’t listen.

“I suppose we should go after her,” Bayliff remarked. “Hate to lose the Pentahedron to her musing.”

Cursing under his breath, Ulrin followed after Cryaliss to see what was so important.

She stopped in front of a door that he had been very familiar with. It was Gerevin’s lab.

“This was where Gerevin was doing his research in the days before The Bleeding,” Ulrin explained. “Your sense is coming from in there?”

She nodded.

Though he knew they would be better pressing on and leaving it be, Ulrin couldn’t help but be drawn by his curiosity. He had never been allowed in that room, never been able to see what Gerevin had been working on so intently that it had consumed his life. And now, Cryaliss was sensing something inside. Could it be something that would finally give them some answers?

“Let’s check it out,” Ulrin decided. “But be quick. We don’t know where Gerevin is or what route he’s taken to the throne room, and we still need to catch him.”

Cryaliss opened the door, and they were met with the smell of death and decay.

The first thing they saw were the bodies. They sat on surgical tables and were in deep stages of decomposition. Various instruments were sticking out of them. Other surgical implements sat on nearby tables, along with an area of beakers and tubes.

While Ulrin stood in shock, Cryaliss calmly stepped inside.

“I’ve seen this before,” she said as she examined a pile of papers. “Yes, and this handwriting is the same. That’s why this felt familiar. It’s the same as the secret laboratory from the University.”

“The one you discovered under the library?” Bayliff clarified. “So, the prince was working under my nose the entire time and didn’t even bother to extend an invitation? The nerve.”

Bayliff followed Cryaliss into the lab, but Ulrin couldn’t bring himself to go inside. The smell was awful. As were the implications.

Anything Gerevin did after The Bleeding could be excused as a product of the Corruption, the struggle against the Blud shifting his personality. Or the reality of the apocalyptic world forcing him to be crueler. But this was before that. This was Gerevin in a world at peace, in full control of his mind. What had he done?

“This confirms that Gerevin was aware that there was something wrong with the Blud before The Bleeding,” Bayliff said as he leafed through a pile of notes. “Seems at this point he was unclear on just how bad it was, though. His research was to determine the extent of the problem and ways to counteract it. This appears to be the report he was compiling to present to the king.”

“And those?” Ulrin asked, pointing to the rotting corpses.

Cryaliss picked up a journal near one of the bodies and flipped it open. Her face blanched. “This is . . . I don’t know if you want to hear this, Ulrin.”

He wasn’t sure, either. “Tell me.”

“He needed research subjects, so he . . . he recruited the terminally ill from around the capital. He told them he was working on a treatment that would extend their life. When they got here, he would give them a dose of Blud and then use them for his experiments and observations. It looks like . . . it looks like all of his subjects eventually died.”

Ulrin felt sick. He couldn’t believe this had been going on right underneath his feet while he slept soundly in his bed. That his caring and wise brother was actually a monster, taking advantage of the most desperate.

“He should have just been honest,” Bayliff commented. “They were already dying; they may have just volunteered to put their bodies and the end of their lives to good purpose. Gerevin clearly is in need of a lesson in research ethics.”

“I’ll be sure to let him know,” Ulrin said, swallowing his bile. “Unless you see anything we can use, we should move on.”

“Wait.” Cryaliss, who had still been intently studying the journal, suddenly darted off to the other side of the lab. “This. This is what gave off the strongest aura. It’s refined Drakenblud.”

She held up a small vial with golden flowers engraved across its sides, filled with a murky black liquid. Ulrin recognized it at once. It was the Blud that was meant to be used in his ceremony.

“That’s the Drakenblud that went missing on the day of The Bleeding,” he said. “The one that was supposed to be used in the ceremony to turn me Bludded. This means that it was Gerevin who stole it. I can’t believe it. All this time, I thought it was a thief or a spy. I never suspected my own brother would be the saboteur. But it seems I didn’t know him nearly as well as I thought.”

“Gerevin knew the Drakenblud had problems,” Cryaliss responded. “Maybe he was just trying to protect you from becoming Corrupted.”

“I agree,” Bayliff said. “Had your ceremony gone as planned, it’s likely you would have joined your father in the wholesale slaughter of your friends and subjects.”

Ulrin took the vial from Cryaliss and studied it, lost in thought. He didn’t know what was true anymore. Everything he thought he knew about his brother kept getting turned on its head. If only he could catch up to him and get the answers straight from his mouth.

“Well, look who has returned.” An eerily familiar voice broke Ulrin out of his stupor. “Prince Ulrin. It is so good to see you again.”

Ulrin spun around and saw what could only be described as a ghost. “Master Solden? You’re alive.”

The Swordmaster, once a handsome man by all accounts, was now covered in burns and scars. He had a wild look in his eyes. “Prince Ulrin. It is a real family reunion. You know, I just ran into your brother.” He laughed, the wild laugh of the insane.

“Where is Gerevin, Master Solden?” Ulrin asked. He kept a hand on the sheath of Silverlight, remembering how their last encounter had ended.

“He’s got himself a bit stuck. Perhaps you ought to aid him. He’s right down at the end of this hall. Yes, this hall here.”

With that, Solden took off at a full sprint down the tunnel.

“Hey, wait!” Ulrin called out but to no response.

Bayliff came up beside him. “It’s clearly a trap.”

“Yes. But if Gerevin really is down here, we need to find him.” He looked back at Cryaliss, who seemed lost in thought. “Cryaliss, let’s go. I’m counting on your senses.”

She snapped back to reality. “Yes! I’m right behind you!”

For some reason, Ulrin tucked the vial of Drakenblud into a pocket. Then, the group took off together in pursuit of the Swordmaster.`,

      title: "Chapter 29",
      content: `Cryaliss followed close behind Ulrin through the tunnels of the under-castle, but her mind was elsewhere. Something was nagging at the back of her mind, something she couldn’t quite put her finger on. It was something to do with Gerevin’s notes, both what she had seen here and in the lab at the University.

She was no scientist. Surely if an important conclusion was to be drawn, Bayliff would have made it when he glanced through the notes. Yet there was something so familiar about Gerevin’s drawings of the flow of Blud through the human body, his diagrams of the points of anatomy where he saw the Corruption spread, and his observations about the smell, texture, and color of Blud that had shown the taint.

Idly, she fondled the Pentahedron cradled in her arms as her mind worked through the mystery. Feeling the presence of the BludSeed inside, it finally came to her.

The Blud was behaving like raw Drakenblud. She had worked with it many times, refining it for use after it had been produced by a BludSeed. It matched up to her experiences with the looks and feel of raw Drakenblud, and the drawings were reflective of the patterns used by the Maidens in the purification process. Well, not exactly. They were similar to the patterns if the motions were reversed.

But what could that mean? Was the Corruption being caused by the refinement of the Blud being undone somehow? No, that could hardly explain the crimson rain or the horrific mutations experienced by those who came into contact with it. Yet it was too much to be a coincidence.

Maybe Bayliff would be able to rationalize her findings, but he and Ulrin seemed caught up with the chase at the moment. Their current situation did have to take priority. She would have to remember to bring it up with him later.

They came to the end of the tunnel. There was a single black metal door here, sealed from this end, but no sign of the Swordmaster.

“Solden!” Ulrin shouted, twisting his head about to look around for a missed turn or hidden passage. “Where are you? Show yourself.”

“He hasn’t passed through here,” said Bayliff, examining the heavy latch on the door. “Though it is clear this is what he wanted to lead us to. Whatever trap he is hoping we will walk into is likely on the other side.”

“It’s Gerevin.” Cryaliss could never forget that sick sensation she got being near him. It was different from any other Corrupted. It was as if her senses were being assaulted by flame and sulfur.

“You’re sure?” Ulrin asked.

“Yes. He’s the only one who gives off this feeling.”

Bayliff put a hand to his chin. “Troubling. Gerevin doesn’t strike me as the cooperative type, so it is doubtful he’s working with Solden. Which means either he has fallen victim to the same trap . . .”

“Or he is the trap,” Ulrin finished. “Doesn’t matter. I’ve come too far trying to catch up to him. You two wait out here. I’ll go and try to talk to him.”

Ulrin pulled at the latch, which protested for a bit before giving in and allowing Ulrin to lift it. Then he pulled the heavy door open, straining as he did so from the weight.

Cryaliss stood in the doorway as Ulrin slowly approached the sole figure in the massive chamber beyond. It was hard to make him out in the dark, but his height and build matched Gerevin. He was on the ground, curled up in a ball and shaking back and forth.

Ulrin slowly approached, bringing his lantern forward to reveal the figure. Gerevin looked awful. Gone was the menacing and composed figure who seemed immune to the dirt and grime of travel, with his air of regality mixed with intimidation. Now he was sweaty, his hair plastered to the front of his face and his clothing sticking to his skin. He seemed paler than ever and gaunt. He reminded Cryaliss of the very ill in their final days before being claimed by a wasting disease.

“Gerevin!” Ulrin called out. “Are you alright? What has happened to you?”

“So hungry,” Gerevin muttered, though whether that was in response to Ulrin or spoken to the void was unclear. “Hunger, hunger. Not enough. Never enough. Foolish, foolish.”

His voice came quick and raspy, a far cry from the cold and calm voice he had spoken with during their last encounter.

“Hungry?” Ulrin reached for his pack. “I have food. Hold on.”

Gerevin looked up as if noticing Ulrin standing there for the first time. “Ulrin? No. No, you shouldn’t be here. Go away now. Go away. I can’t . . . I’ll . . .” He clutched at his head, his nails digging into his flesh so hard that even from the doorway, Cryaliss could see blood start to flow.

Ulrin stiffened. “Gerevin, what is going on with you? Get back in control.”

“No, no Gerevin left,” the hunched figure replied. “Gerevin fought, but he lost. Only the Blud remains now. The Blud and the hunger.”

“I know that isn’t true,” Ulrin insisted. “You’ve managed to keep control for years. There’s no way a few days stuck in the darkness could have undone that!”

“The darkness?” Gerevin laughed a sick cackle that sent chills down Cryaliss’s spine. “No, the darkness does not bother. The darkness shrouds. It protects. No, it is the hunger that defeated Gerevin. He was too spoiled, too weak to deal with the hunger. Always ready to eat when the weakness set in. Did not bring enough. No, he did not. Foolish, foolish.”

Ulrin pulled out a small pouch that contained a day’s rations and tossed it down near his brother. “There, if you’re so hungry, that should help.”

Gerevin didn’t so much as look at the pouch. Instead, his eyes fixed on Ulrin. He licked his lips. “You should have run, Ulrin. He tried to hold me back. But I am the hunter, and you are the prey. And I hunger.”

Before Ulrin could say anything else, Gerevin launched himself at his brother. Like a feral animal, he bolted on all fours toward him and tackled him to the ground. Ulrin yelled out as he struggled to push Gerevin off him. His wild brother snapped his teeth dangerously close to Ulrin’s face. To everyone’s shock and horror, it seemed Gerevin was not content with simply beating his brother this time.

He was trying to eat him.

Ulrin managed to roll over and throw Gerevin off of him, but the feral prince wasn’t done with him. He came charging at Ulrin again, grabbing his shoulders and throwing him into the wall.

Cryaliss watched as the brothers fought, horrified. Ulrin was able to draw his sword while Gerevin circled like a stalking predator. Gerevin attacked, and Ulrin slashed. The older brother howled as Silverlight cut him through the side and leaped back. He didn’t stay back long, though, and attempted another attack. Ulrin kept his back to the wall and again fended off the attack with his sword, leaving a long cut across Gerevin’s arm.

Gerevin was faster and stronger, but things were unfolding much differently than the other times the brothers fought. In his savagery, Gerevin was forgoing any tactics or defense, nor did he seem to learn from his attempts that were repelled. Each time Ulrin struck him back, Gerevin simply repeated the attack, and Ulrin’s hits were getting deeper, closer to a fatal strike. If this kept up, Ulrin would kill his brother.

Ulrin already carried so much guilt on his shoulders. She couldn’t let him add to his burdens. But what could she do? The Pentahedron was heavy in her hands. She could use it against Gerevin, but that would violate her promise to only use it as a last resort.

A thought came to her. Or more of an impulse, as she didn’t have time to think through whether this was a good idea. If she had, she certainly would have come to the opposite conclusion.

Dropping the artifact, she rushed into the chamber, ignoring Bayliff’s startled protests, and made straight for Gerevin. The crazed prince was so distracted by his brother that he did not even notice her coming. She grabbed him from behind and put him into a reverse hug. He was surprised for a moment, then started to thrash wildly, an animal trying to shake off an unwanted pest. She held on tight and tried to focus.

As she made contact, she was able to sense the blood flowing inside Gerevin and feel the taint there. It was vile, sickening, but also familiar. Like she had realized from Gerevin’s notes, it was much like the unrefined Drakenblud she had worked with countless times.

Which meant she could purify it. Maybe.

Pain shot through her arm as Gerevin’s struggling dislocated a shoulder, and her chest hurt from the strain of him pressing back against her. Somewhere close, someone was screaming her name. Ulrin, probably. She blocked everything else out and focused purely on her work.

She found the threads of Gerevin’s lifeblood and traced them to the points of his body where his anatomical diagrams had suggested the Corruption took hold. Then she pulled on that thread, twisting it until it took the form of the sigil of her order. Energy pulsed through his body, and he screamed.

Cryaliss persisted. Heart to lungs, lungs to kidneys, kidneys to liver, she went through Gerevin’s anatomy and attempted to purify his blood. Each time, she could swear his struggling waned, but whether that was due to his injuries or her work, she could not tell.

By some miracle, she was able to finish her work. She released Gerevin and fell to the ground, gasping for breath and aching all over. She wasn’t able to move.

If that had not worked, she would have been defenseless and likely to die.

Gerevin looked back at her, and she braced herself for the end. Ulrin rushed to her, but he would not be fast enough.

She had tried.

Gerevin doubled over and began to vomit. Cryaliss could barely push herself away with her feet enough to avoid the main deluge, but some of the splash scattered upon her.

Ulrin had reached Gerevin and had his sword at his throat. Gerevin growled and wiped his mouth.

“Your companions are as foolish as you are, Ulrin,” Gerevin said, his voice still raspy but far steadier. “How any of you have managed to survive this long is beyond me.”

Ulrin looked between Gerevin and Cryaliss, rage and uncertainty competing on his face. “You best explain yourself now, or I will kill you.”

Gerevin sighed, then, with a speed far beyond what Cryaliss’s eyes could follow, he reached out, grabbed Ulrin’s sword hand, pulled Silverlight from his grip, and tossed it onto the other side of the chamber.

Ulrin gasped and stumbled back, clutching his hand.

“Calm yourself, brother,” Gerevin said. “If I wanted to kill you, you would be dead already.”

Gerevin put a hand to the side of his own neck and pushed, which elicited a loud crack. Then he kneeled in front of Cryaliss. “I apologize for getting my sick on you. I was caught very off-guard. Now my mind is clearer than it’s been in a long time. What exactly did you do?”

Cryaliss pushed herself onto her knees. “I refined it like raw Drakenblud. I wasn’t sure if that would work or not. I’ve never refined Blud already flowing in someone’s lifeblood. But I thought it might be possible after seeing your research.”

Gerevin raised his arm, where a long gash left by Ulrin’s sword still bled, brought that wound up to his nose, and sniffed it. “Amazing. Temporary, for sure. The Corruption is endemic. It cannot be wholly stopped by treating one individual. But to think the symptoms could be reversed to this extent and so quickly . . . If I had known, I would have pursued the Blood Maidens much sooner in my research.”

“I wonder if the Matrons knew,” Cryaliss said, more to herself than to Gerevin. Was that what their work had been? The work they had been unable to finish due to Cryaliss causing the fall of the temple?

Ulrin, seeming to finally come to his senses after being left dumbfounded, pushed past his brother to reach Cryaliss and help her to her feet. “Are you alright? What were you thinking?”

She was weak on her feet and needed Ulrin to support her. “I’ll be fine. I just need to catch my breath. I’m sorry for troubling you, but you looked like you needed saving.”

“Hey, I think I was actually winning that one,” Ulrin said, sounding offended. “Don’t know if I needed saving.”

Gerevin scoffed. “Only because my mind had degraded to that of a child.”

“Not saving from death,” Cryaliss clarified. “But from being forced to kill your brother.”

Ulrin looked back at his brother, who was busy examining his injuries. “I guess you were right about that.”

“Well, I thank you for your assistance, Maiden,” Gerevin said, turning toward the door. “Now, if you’ll excuse me.”

Bayliff stood in the doorway, arms crossed. “Oh, come now, prince. One researcher to another, you can’t expect me to believe you don’t have questions burning in your mind after this turn of events, and you’re going to walk away from the one person in the world who can answer them. I’m sure Cryaliss would be more than happy to oblige if you answer some of our questions as well.”

Gerevin hesitated.

“You owe us,” Ulrin added.

“Fine.” Gerevin shrugged. “It will take my body a little while to heal these wounds you so rudely dug into my flesh. I’ll humor you until then.”

Despite her pain and exhaustion, Cryaliss felt a flutter of joy at this small level of cooperation from Gerevin. It would undoubtedly be an important moment for Ulrin.

Ulrin coughed. “Well, shit. I didn’t honestly think we would get this far. I have so many questions. I don’t know where to start.”

“Allow me to take the first, then,” Bayliff said. He continued to stand in the doorway instead of entering the chamber, perhaps out of caution. “Earlier, you called the Corruption endemic, implying that reversing your condition was impermanent. Have you figured out the nature of the Corruption?”

Gerevin scowled, and Cryaliss worried that his momentary cooperation had already come to an end.

“I have a notion,” Gerevin finally replied. “But I will keep the details to myself. I don’t want to put any ideas in my brother’s head, particularly if it turns out I’m wrong. I will confirm that any treatment is temporary. The Bleeding is persistent. Even when the crimson rain is not falling, its taint lingers in the air. That’s why those of us who are already Bludded do not need to be touched by the rain to be transformed. It is only a matter of time before the Blud within me is tainted once more.”

“How have you fought it off this long?” Ulrin asked. “Why haven’t you mutated and gone insane like our father or Master Jeffries?”

“By drinking blood,” Gerevin said in a chilling monotone. “The taint can be diluted by introducing uncorrupted blood into my system. I hunt untouched animals and drain them. As long as I have enough to drink, I can keep my control against the madness, though it can be a struggle. Once my mind goes, my body will follow shortly.”

Ulrin looked like he was going to be sick. “So, when you were babbling about being hungry . . .”

“I’m afraid my dependence on blood may have developed into an addiction. In my near-rabid state, I was growing desperate.”

An awkward pause. “If you had just said you needed some of my blood, I would have given you some, you know. As gross as that would be.”

“I’ll keep that in mind for the future,” Gerevin replied flatly. “Though I would prefer if our paths would stop crossing so frequently.”

“Oh, would you?”

Cryaliss decided to try to play peacemaker once more. “Don’t pretend you aren’t happy to see your brother alive and well. I can sense your feelings.” She was lying, but the mysterious nature of her Blood Maiden abilities had to work in her favor sometimes.

Gerevin looked annoyed. “Fine. I’ll admit to still being concerned about my brother. But that’s the reason why I would like him to cease these pursuits. The path I walk is a dangerous one, but one I am capable of surviving with the strength, durability, and speed granted to me by the Drakenblud. Ulrin, for all his talent, is still mortal. He will die if he keeps this up.”

“I’m still mortal because you stole the vial of Blud meant for me,” Ulrin accused.

The older brother hesitated. “Yes. Because if you had taken it, you would have been tainted, either becoming a monster like our father or being forced to rely on drinking blood to maintain your sanity, like me. Neither was a fate I wanted for you.”

Ulrin deflated a bit. “Well, when you put it like that . . .”

Gerevin took charge of the conversation from there, asking Cryaliss a series of questions about the refinement process and other secrets of the Drakenblud that only the Maidens would know. Cryaliss did her best to answer each question as completely and honestly as she could, although, unfortunately, much of the knowledge were things that only the Matrons would have known. Still, Gerevin seemed satisfied with the answers he received.

When Gerevin examined his wounds and saw they had completely sealed, he abruptly ended the conversation. “That is the conclusion. I must now finish what I came here to do and kill the king. You all wait down here on the sub-levels until I am finished. I will return when it is safe.”

“Oh, no, you don’t. I’m going with you,” Ulrin declared. “I’ve been waiting too long for this to let you do it on your own. Plus, as you’ve seen, I can help. Silverlight is a great weapon for fighting the Corrupted, and you can’t wield it. It might be just the trick needed to put our father down.”

“You’ll just ignore me if I refuse your help, won’t you?”

“Yes.”

“Fine. But try to stay out of the way.”

Cryaliss did not need a pretend Maiden ability to tell that Gerevin was glad to have his brother by his side.

---

“I can’t believe there are that many of them.” Cryaliss had regained much of her strength as they ascended the castle, but now it felt like her knees were ready to buckle again.

Gerevin sniffed the air. “It’s almost every Corrupted in the entire castle. They’ve all gathered together to block our path.”

Ulrin tensely looked about, his hands gripping tight on his sword. He wouldn’t be able to sense the Corrupted like Cryaliss, but he could hear them milling about. “Master Jeffries had some ability to influence the other Corrupted, at least to an extent. Could our father have called them all here?”

“He’s hiding from us.” Gerevin scoffed. “Coward.”

They had made their way up from the sub-levels to the keep and were now within spitting distance of the throne room. Along the way, they had noted the surprising absence of any Corrupted. Now they knew why.

“It’s more than even I can take,” Gerevin added. “We’ll be overwhelmed the moment we enter the next room.”

Ulrin looked to Bayliff. “Do you have enough firebombs left to make us a path?”

“After our dramatic entrance? Unfortunately, no,” Bayliff replied. “Between the pillar, the fighting that followed, and covering our retreat, I’m down to just two on my person. If we went back down to the labs, I could check if they have the components to make more, but it is doubtful. They are incredibly specific, and many cannot be found naturally in Lorn.”

“Well, that’s it then.” Gerevin turned as if he intended to leave. “There’s nothing more that can be done here.”

Ulrin stepped in front of him, blocking his path. “Wait, you can’t be serious. You’re just going to give up?”

Gerevin gave him a steady look. “Come now, Ulrin. Even your idealism and stubbornness need to meet their limit at some point. There is only one path into the throne room, and walking through it is tantamount to suicide. It is time to cut your losses and focus your efforts elsewhere.”

“I can’t believe you would just leave!” Ulrin was yelling, heedless of the creatures just out of sight. “All that bravado about me staying behind, about how you are going to handle things yourself, but the moment you face some adversity, you tuck your tail between your legs and run!”

“This childishness is why I wanted you to stay behind. You don’t stop and think about your limitations.”

“Oh, I’m the one with limitations? I’m not the one running!”

The two brothers argued back and forth. It was strangely nice, in a way. Cryaliss remembered what it was like to have siblings. The sibling rivalry, the bickering. They might both be grown and changed from their experiences, but at the end of the day, they still behaved like brothers.

Cryaliss began to walk toward the next room. She knew what she had to do. Already, her senses were drifting into the Pentahedron and the BludSeed within.

She was halfway to the door before the others noticed.

“Wait. Cryaliss, what are you doing?” Ulrin called after her.

She picked up her pace, determined to do this before Ulrin could catch and stop her. “It’s time, Ulrin. This is what I came here for. Now finish what you came here for.”

Ulrin’s footfalls came after her, but he wouldn’t be fast enough. She knew that, despite his promises, he would have trouble letting her go when the time came. It was better this way. He wouldn’t have the burden of allowing her to sacrifice herself. It was her decision made of her own accord.

It came easier to her this time. As she went through the motions to activate the Pentahedron, she could feel the threads naturally form between the artifact and the horde of creatures. There were so many of them. Hundreds of them. More than she could keep track of. She just had to trust that the artifact was connecting to them all.

The defiance in the BludSeed was there, ever present as it was. But it seemed more subdued. Nervous.

“You feel it, too, don’t you?” Cryaliss whispered into the box. “How unnatural they are. They are not worth your protection.”

Was it just her imagination, or did the artifact beat in response?

“I know how you must feel,” she continued. “You were once part of the heart of a mighty dragon. I can’t imagine how awful it must have felt to be put inside a weapon to be used against your kind. But these are not your brothers. They are twisted mockeries of what the dragons once were. So don’t protect them. Let us destroy these creatures together.”

She stepped through the threshold to the next room and was met with howls and screams as the horde of creatures descended on her. There was only going to be one chance at this. If she messed it up, if the Pentahedron was too stubborn, she would be torn apart.

Cryaliss turned the bottom of the artifact one last time and pushed her energy into the Pentahedron.

It opened up to her. The BludSeed beat rapidly, a heartbeat under strain and stress. Her heartbeat sped up to match it until they were beating in unison.

Power cascaded down the threads with each beat. One thread after another saw the surge of energy, and the creature at the end burst from the inside.

Beat. A howl of pain. Beat. A disturbingly human scream. Beat. The eyes of a nearby Corrupted burst as their blood boiled inside them.

She knew her body wouldn’t be able to take this. Even if she hadn’t already been exhausted from treating Gerevin, the amount of energy flowing from her body was more than she could afford to spare. Her heart was beating too fast, her breath becoming too ragged. Every ounce of her life was being drawn from her.

But she felt no regret.

Every day since the awful experience of losing her sisters, she had been looking for a purpose in being alive. And this was it. It was far grander than anything she should have hoped for. Ending the unnatural suffering of hundreds of Corrupted. Helping others with their mission. It was a good way to go. She was grateful.

She was vaguely aware of Ulrin calling her name.

Leaving him behind . . . she had one regret, after all. How she would have liked to be with him more. A selfish notion, but perhaps she had earned just one.

He would carry on. She had faith in him.

Beat. Beat. Beat. The beating of her heart and of the BludSeed hit its crescendo, and energy pulsed through the last of the threads. The room became silent as the final Corrupted met their ends.

Then the beating stopped. The beating of the BludSeed. And her heartbeat.

She had nothing left.

The world went dark before she hit the floor.`,

      content: `Ulrin was too late. He could only look in horror at Cryaliss’s still body, surrounded on all sides by a bloody, gory mess of fallen Corrupted. Her eyes were open, but there was no life in them. No breath was drawn into her lips.

She was dead.

His hands clenched into a fist so hard that his fingers drew blood. This was his fault. If he had just been paying attention instead of getting into another argument with Gerevin . . .

No, that was doing her sacrifice a disservice. He had promised to let her make the decision of what to do with her life. And she had fulfilled her promise of only using the artifact when there was no other choice. If she had not, there was no way they were getting past that horde.

He bent over and picked up the Pentahedron. It was cracked and broken. Apparently, Cryaliss was not the only one to be sacrificed. He put the broken artifact in her hand and over her chest. It seemed fitting, like a warrior laid to rest with their sword. If Ulrin survived his battle with his father, he would see that she was properly buried like that. He owed her that much.

Gerevin and Bayliff waited quietly. Their faces were stoic. They did not offer any words of comfort or condolence. Ulrin did not expect any. Death was a constant companion in this new world. You accepted it and moved on.

This was why it was so dangerous to get attached.

“Let’s not waste this opportunity she has given us,” Ulrin said, trying not to let his voice crack. “The king awaits.”

They approached the doors of the throne room.

“I’ll wait out here,” Bayliff declared. “I’d just get in the way in there. I’ll give you a shout if anything comes this way.”

Ulrin nodded, then turned to his brother. “You ready?”

“Just follow my lead.”

In some ways, the throne room was just as Ulrin remembered it. The throne on its dais, the massive dragon skull, the heraldry on the wall, all of it might have been frozen in time, ready to hold court on that day five years ago. The illusion was broken by all the scorching. The floors, walls, banisters, and pillars were all covered in deep black burns. The ceiling had been caved in, and black stonework littered the balconies. Though the fires had long been extinguished, the smell of smoke still permeated the chamber.

The room shook as they entered, and Ulrin’s hearing was assaulted by rumbling, like someone breathing heavily directly into his ears.

“MY SONS RETURN . . . TRAITORS! YOU ABANDON YOUR HOME . . . ABANDON YOUR DUTIES . . . RETURN AFTER ALL THIS TIME . . . AND SLAY OUR LOYAL SUBJECTS . . .”

Ulrin spun around, Silverlight at the ready, but could not find the source of the voice. “They were no longer our subjects. Nor are you any longer our father. Show yourself!”

“YOU DARE . . . SPEAK THAT WAY TO YOUR KING!”

Gerevin walked to the center of the room. “What do you believe yourself to be the king of? Ashes?”

“KING OF LORN . . . KING OF THE BLUD . . . KING OF HUNTERS!”

Ulrin circled the edge of the room around the dragon skull. “King of hunters? Is that why you killed my mother and siblings?”

“THEY WERE WEAK . . . THE WEAK ARE PREY . . . I AM KING, AND I MAKE THE LAW . . . THE ONE AND ONLY LAW OF LORN . . . PREY ARE HUNTED!”

“Up there,” Gerevin declared, pointing at the ruined ceiling. “He’s coming down. Get ready!”

On cue, the shaking of the room grew louder, and the King of Lorn crawled his way out of the ceiling.

At first glance, he appeared to have become the very type of dragon that Lorn had been founded to contest. But as the light reached him, it became clear that, if anything, his form mocked the very notion of the Draconic, imitating them with human flesh and sinew like a sick joke. Long bones formed the basis for pink, fleshy wings, and a carapace formed of leathery fingers covered his underside. The bones of his head were twisted to match the shape of the dragon skull in the room, the flesh pulled too tight over it. He was huge, thrice the size of either Gerevin or Ulrin, and filled the room with a sickening heat just with his presence.

“YOU HAVE THE BLUD IN YOU . . .” the king declared to Gerevin as he settled a single foot upon the throne, which encompassed most of it. “BUT YOU RESIST THE CALL OF THE HUNTER . . . JOIN ME . . . SLAY THIS WEAK ONE . . . BECOME WHAT YOU WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE!”

Gerevin glanced briefly between Ulrin and his father. “Ulrin? Weak? Now you have lost your mind, father. You should know as well as I that Ulrin was always the strongest of all of us.”

This answer did not seem to please the King of the Corrupted, whose face twisted further into a snarl. “SO BE IT!”

With a loud bellow, the king suddenly shot forth a plume of flames from his mouth. Gerevin dodged, his inhuman speed allowing him to easily avoid the fire. When the king turned his attention to Ulrin, he was not as quick. Ulrin tried to duck low under the flaming stream, but the flames cut a line across his back.

The Amulet of Fireproofing found in The Vault glowed and began to radiate a severe cold, so cold that Ulrin worried that he would have frost burn on his chest to go along with the fire burns on his back. But when the flames died down, Ulrin found himself mostly unharmed. Singed, and the hair on the back of his head was shorter than it had been, but none of the pain he would expect from a serious burn. The amulet also returned to its usual temperature.

It seemed to have done its job protecting him from the flames. He’d have to thank Bayliff.

Gerevin leaped at the king and grabbed him by the throat. In turn, the king grabbed him with his talons across the shoulders, and the two became locked in a fierce struggle. It was an odd sight to see them grappling like that, matching strength despite the ridiculous difference in size. But if anything, Gerevin seemed to be getting the better of it. The king tried to breathe fire again, but Gerevin forced his head up, and the flames shot up into the ceiling.

Ulrin rushed forward to aid his brother, Silverlight poised for the strike. He got up onto the dais and pointed the sword toward the king’s side.

King Emberlind whipped his body around suddenly, and Ulrin was struck with a long, spindly tail. The wind was knocked out of him, and he went flying across the room, landing hard on his back.

The king then beat his twisted wings and took off into the air, still in a grapple with Gerevin. He pried Gerevin from the throat and tossed him roughly to the ground, then dived down after him. Gerevin rolled out of the way just in time to avoid being crushed by a massive foot.

Ulrin rolled back to his feet, grabbed Silverlight, and rushed back into the fray. The king swung around again, but Ulrin was ready for that trick this time. He angled Silverlight so it would meet the tail at the moment of impact and braced. The tail hit the impossibly sharp blade at incredible speed and was severed clean in two at the point of contact. The king let out a cry of pain as his tail flopped uselessly across the floor.

Gerevin took the advantage provided, bolting toward the king and laying into him with a series of rapid punches. Each strike resounded like thunder, and indentations formed on King Emberlind’s carapace as bones broke and flesh deformed from the pure force of those blows. Ulrin had a brief thought of just how much Gerevin must have held back when they had fought.

Ulrin rushed from behind, but the king beat his wings and took off into the air once more. Ulrin could do nothing from the ground, but Gerevin did not stop. He leaped off the ground, rushed upside down along the ruins of the ceiling, and leaped down upon the king’s back. He grabbed the king by the back of the head and twisted, trying to break the creature’s neck.

King Emberlind roared and spiraled in the air, throwing Gerevin off his back with a grunt. As Gerevin fell, the king struck him with his claw. Blood streamed from a fresh wound on Gerevin’s chest, lingering in the air a moment before they all came to a hard landing on the ground.

Ulrin was there quickly and attempted to draw the king’s attention away from his wounded brother. He struck out and landed a clean hit across the king’s side. Silverlight dug deep, piercing through flesh and bone and drawing a deluge of ichor and unidentifiable masses.

The king screamed louder than ever before. The room shook from the force of it, and Ulrin instinctively covered his ears. The scream dug into his brain and dizzied his thoughts. For a moment, he was worried his head would burst from the pressure.

The sound stopped all of a sudden, but before Ulrin could regain his composure, he was hit with a staggering force. The king struck and grabbed him with a mighty claw, rending through Ulrin’s padding. Ulrin was caught there, his entire chest being compressed. The claw squeezed and dug deeper, beginning to pierce Ulrin’s skin. Blood stained the front of his gambeson.

If it wasn’t for the enchanted metal plate he had sewed into his padding, giving it the strength of steel, his body would have already been crushed like a tomato, he realized. Another one he would owe Bayliff, if he somehow survived.

Gerevin appeared and struck out toward the king’s face. His hand shot out straight like a knife and pierced into one of the king’s eyes. It came out just as fast, bringing with it a burst of ichor and the king’s eye firmly in his grasp like a trophy.

The king flailed about in pain, then tossed Ulrin aside like a sack of old laundry. Ulrin flew across the air before landing at the top of the dragon skull. He groaned and struggled to get up, but the pain in his chest was immense.

Below, Gerevin dodged between the king’s attacks. He leaped a plume of flames and nearly vanished as he avoided a swipe of the claws. Another punch landed across the king’s face.

But this time, the king did not flinch, and Gerevin did not retract his hand fast enough. The King of the Corrupted snapped his dragon-imitating jaw. There was a sickening crunch and a spurt of blood as Gerevin’s arm was bitten clean off.

Gerevin backed away in shock and pain, and the king got low, in a prowler’s stance, ready to make the killing strike.

He was directly under the skull.

With great effort, Ulrin was able to roll himself off the skull. He landed on the king’s back and grabbed on. The king yelled and shook, trying to throw him off. The force was too much, so Ulrin allowed himself to begin to roll off. But as he passed one of the massive wings, he took a swipe with Silverlight. The sword pulsed as it drove through the wing, cutting it from the king’s twisted body.

Ulrin landed hard on his knees, sending a fresh jolt of pain up his legs. The king rolled wildly across the floor in front of him. Whether he was having a seizure or a tantrum, it was hard to tell.

Gerevin had tied off his wounded stump and stepped up beside Ulrin. “Are you alright?”

“I should be asking you that. You just lost your arm.”

“My body will stop the bleeding soon.”

“Don’t suppose it will also grow your arm back?”

“No. But it was my non-dominant hand, so it is more an inconvenience than anything.”

Ulrin laughed as he struggled to his feet. “You can’t ever just admit you fucked up, huh?”

“No.”

The king stopped his flailing and got back to his feet. He was bleeding from his face, his back, and his side. There was fear in his eyes now, that of a wounded animal that’d been cornered.

“We have him now,” Gerevin said. “Wait for me to make an opening, then make the decisive strike with that sword.”

“Right.”

They faced off and were so distracted that they didn’t notice the intruder until it was too late.

Solden came into the room, fresh blood dripping from his sword, holding aloft one of Bayliff’s firebombs with its fuse already lit.

Ulrin spotted him first. “Gerevin, look out!”

But Solden was already tossing the firebomb toward them. “All of you Emberlind bastards can just die already!”

There was an explosion as the firebomb went off directly beside them. Blinding light. Intense heat. Then the sensation of falling.

And then the impact.`,

      content: `Ulrin’s world was replaced with one of intense pain. His back felt like it had been broken. One of his legs has been twisted the wrong way. His mouth was filled with coppery blood. And then there was the burning sensation all across his body. Guess that amulet had its limits, after all.

He tried to focus, but the pain kept blinding him. Something was pressing against his chest, compressing it and making it impossible to take a full breath. He felt a warm puddle form beneath him. His own blood spilling from his body.

Ulrin knew he was already dead. His body just hadn’t realized it yet.

Somehow, the world came back into view. His mind raced to put together his surroundings. The floor had collapsed from the explosion, and Ulrin had fallen into the chamber below. The dragon skull had fallen after him and landed atop him, crushing his chest and pinning him to the ground.

There was no sign of Gerevin. Given how close the firebomb had been to him when it had gone off . . .

But who he did see was his father.

The king stumbled, dazed, but was still standing. His one remaining eye fixed on Ulrin, and a grin formed on that grotesque face.

“THE PREY HAS BECOME TRAPPED . . . YOU FOUGHT WELL . . . BUT NOW . . . YOU ARE MINE!”

He slowly began to lumber forward, dragging a limp leg behind him. Though the king was badly wounded, he would have no trouble finishing off Ulrin as things stood.

Ulrin laughed with what little air he could get into his lungs. This seemed to startle his father, who stopped in his tracks.

“Some hunter you turned out to be,” Ulrin rasped. “Beaten by your prey. Barely able to survive. Saved by the interference of one of the weak. You couldn’t kill me face-to-face, so you have to resort to killing me while I am stuck. What a pathetic excuse for a hunter.”

“DON’T YOU MOCK ME . . . I AM THE KING OF HUNTERS!”

“Look at your face and say that.” It was getting harder and harder to get any words out, but this was the only gambit Ulrin had left.

“TRAPPED OR NOT . . . I WOULD KILL YOU IN AN INSTANT . . .”

Consciousness was fading fast. Ulrin hoped that this would work. “Prove it. Take this thing off of me and face me like a hunter.”

King Emberlind roared. He grabbed the dragon skull by its eye socket and pulled it up.

Ulrin let in a gasp of air. That was a start. He still couldn’t move and was still dying from a combination of being broken and blood loss. But with his hands free, he could move on to the second part of his desperate gambit.

He reached into his pocket, pulled out the vial of refined Drakenblud meant for him, removed the cork, and drank it.

His body became flooded with ice. No, this sensation was colder than the most frigid ice he had ever encountered, and it was running right through his veins. The sensation caused him to want to scream, but he couldn’t open his mouth. His entire body, every muscle, every sinew, was locked into place.

Then things began to crack. Pop, crack, snap. It was his bones, he realized. They were shifting, breaking, and reforming. His muscles joined them, tearing and stitching themselves back together. It was as if his entire body was being torn apart and reassembled, bit by bit. There were no words in his mind that could adequately describe the agony.

New colors rushed into his vision. New smells flooded his nose. Every sensation became amplified a thousand times.

He thought he could have been lying there a hundred years, given how long he seemed to endure the suffering. But as he slowly regained control of his body and was able to lift his head, he spotted his father still struggling with the dragon skull, just now setting it down beside him. Only seconds had passed.

“NOW YOU WILL SEE WHY I AM KING!” his father declared.

Ulrin slowly rose to his feet, much to the shock of the supposed king. He must have thought Ulrin was too broken to get up. A moment ago, he would have been right. But now, Ulrin felt better than he had ever felt in his life. Stronger. Faster.

And angrier.

“THAT SCENT . . . WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!”

“Just taking my rightful place as a prince of Lorn,” Ulrin said. “Sorry about it being a few years late.”

The king charged at him, but Ulrin dodged. He struck the king on the back as he passed, sending him hard down to the floor. He then leaped onto the back of the king, wrapped both of his hands around his one remaining wing, and pulled. The wing slowly tore free as bones snapped and flesh tore. The king screamed out in utter agony.

King Emberlind went into a roll, and Ulrin leaped off. He landed easily, as if balance had just returned to his body. He could hardly believe how strong he had become. No wonder the Drakenblud was so sought after.

Though he had no intention of enjoying it for long. He would not allow himself to become Corrupted. Once he was done here, he was done for good.

First, he needed to finish his father.

The king let out a plume of fire, and Ulrin braced against it, trusting in the amulet. It went cold, though it was nothing compared to the ice in his veins. The heat beat against Ulrin as if he had walked into an oven, but Ulrin would not retreat from it. He put his hands in front of his face and stepped through it, walking slowly toward his father. Step by step, further into the flames, ignoring the burning of his clothes, his hair, the singing of his flesh. None of that would matter in a moment.

He reached his father and, with all of his force, punched him in the throat. The king choked, and the flames died out. The creature made a gargling noise as it tried to breathe, tried to speak, but its throat had been completely crushed.

Ulrin stepped forward, and that was when he spotted the telltale sparkle of Silverlight near his feet. He reached for the sword, thinking it was a fitting weapon to end things.

“I know you don’t like to be wielded by the Bludded,” he said as he lifted it. “That’s why you defended yourself against Gerevin. But just for one strike, let me wield you. Then you may take my life as well.”

The sword pulsed, and that silvery flowing pattern began to drip a strange liquid, but it dripped around his hand, hitting the floor with a light pitter-patter.

The king, his one eye now fully open in fear, attempted to flee. He beat the stubs of his wings, but all he accomplished was spreading more ichor from his gaping.

“Are you trying to run? Is that what a hunter does? Tell me, father, did my mother try to run? What about my siblings? Did they beg for mercy? Did you ignore their pleas because you thought they were weak? Well, I shall take your lesson for once in my life. There is no one weaker than you. Because of your weakness, you failed your family. You failed your kingdom. And now, you’ve even failed as a hunter. You’re pathetic.”

Some lingering pride must have still remained within that body, as on Ulrin’s mockery, the king charged at him for one last assault.

Ulrin struck as soon as he got close, driving the point of Silverlight directly through the king’s skull and into his brain. The sword flashed, and the head burst open in an eruption of ichor and blood.

And with that, the King of Lorn had been slain. Ulrin’s mission from all these years had been accomplished.

And now, he had just one thing left to do.

Join him.`,

He had hoped that he would encounter Gerevin or Bayliff along the way by some miracle, so he could at least explain himself before he went. But that was wishful thinking. Bayliff must have been killed by Solden to get his firebomb, and Gerevin must have been killed in the ensuing explosion.

With Cryaliss gone, and his father dead, there was nothing and nobody left. Ulrin was completely and utterly alone. But this was not like all the times he had been alone before. That sense of purpose that had driven him on against loneliness and isolation was no longer there. He had accomplished what he had set out to do. There was no purpose in going on.

And even if he had wanted to, and some part of him did, it was too dangerous. He had taken in the Drakenblud. As Gerevin had said, it was only a matter of time before The Bleeding claimed him, and he became a monster like his father. He could not bring himself to drink blood like Gerevin did to control it.

There really was only one option for him left.

The sun had decided to come out. He realized it must have been a month at the least since he had last seen it. It was getting longer and longer without daylight. Maybe this would be the last time the sun shone at all.

Well, that was a problem for those that still lived, if there were any survivors left at all. Right now, he was just glad he could enjoy the sun on his face one last time.

There were worse ways to go, he decided, than on his own terms, with the sun upon him and the beautiful view of the kingdom stretched before him. From here, you could never tell the terrors that had unfolded. Everything seemed so peaceful and right.

He needed to do it before he lost his nerve. One last time, he drew Silverlight from its sheath to fulfill his promise to it. He took it in a reverse grip and brought the blade up to his throat.

Ulrin shut his eyes.

“Ulrin!” a familiar voice called out from the throne room, causing him to hesitate.

It was impossible. He was imagining things. Was the madness already coming for him?

“Ulrin! Where are you? Tell me you’re okay!”

Madness or not, Ulrin could not stop himself. He dropped the sword and rushed back into the throne room.

And there she was, looking for him.

“Cryaliss!” He could barely muster the name as he rushed to her. “How? You were . . . I saw you. You weren’t breathing.”

“I can’t exactly explain it myself. The Pentahedron had stopped my heart. But then, it was on my chest, and the BludSeed inside started to beat, and, I think, my heart was still linked with it, so it started to beat as well.”

Ulrin reached out to touch her, to confirm that she was really there, but then stopped himself, remembering what he had become. “I’m really happy you are alive, Cryaliss. Truly, there is nothing I wanted more. But I’m afraid it’s too late for me. I had to . . . I’ve become . . .”

“You became Bludded,” Cryaliss finished, though there was no sadness or judgment in her voice. “That must have been a tough decision for you, after everything you’ve seen the Bludded do once the Corruption takes them. But we won’t let that happen to you.”

“We won’t?”

“Of course not! I figured out how to treat it, remember? Even if my treatments are only temporary, I’ll keep you from losing yourself until we figure out something else. Don’t worry.” She smiled. “Though that does mean you’re going to have to keep me close for a while. I hope you don’t mind my company for the foreseeable future.”

Ulrin smiled back. “I think I’ll manage.”

They shared a moment together that Ulrin wished could last forever, but it was cut short by the appearance of another surprising survivor.

“Oh, so you’re also still alive,” Bayliff said as he stepped into the throne room. “Well, that makes things a bit simpler. I have plans for the use of this castle, and it will require someone with knowledge of its floor plan. And I don’t think Gerevin will stick around long enough to do the part.”

Ulrin blinked in surprise. “You’re alive, Bayliff? Wait, Gerevin is alive as well?”

“Of course I’m alive. It’ll take more than a cheap shot while my back is turned to put me down for good. As for Gerevin, yes. He’s currently dealing with my firebomb thief. I almost feel sorry for the poor bastard.”

Shortly later, Ulrin would learn what Bayliff meant by that when he saw Gerevin feasting on the former Swordmaster’s blood. Solden was still alive for most of it, his hands held out, as if pleading for his former student to come to save him. He left him to the fate he had earned.

As Bayliff had predicted, Gerevin did not plan to stay. He had further work to do in his journey to uncover the root of The Bleeding. To Ulrin’s surprise, Gerevin actually let him know where he was going. Or gave him a hint, anyway.

“I’ll be heading across the border to Irimire,” Gerevin said on the day of his departure. “Though Lorn became the focal point of The Bleeding, it is not its origin, and I believe I will get my answers in the lands of our neighbors.”

“Why are you sharing this?” Ulrin asked.

Gerevin shrugged. “I expect your idealism will force you to find a new mission to risk your life against before long. I figured I might as well point you in the right direction.”

“You’re saying you think I would be useful to your search?”

“If that’s what you want to take from it.”

Ulrin smiled. “You could just say you need an extra hand, you know.”

“Is that a joke about my missing arm?”

“Of course it is.”

Ulrin sighed. “It is tempting, and I will certainly keep that in mind. Might not be able to follow for a while, though. Bayliff thinks we can use the castle to protect and relieve the suffering of the survivors in Lorn. He’s an asshole, but also a really smart guy. I feel like I’m obligated to see where this goes, if there’s really any way I can help our people survive.”

“Spoken like a true prince,” Gerevin replied.

“And it only took the end of the world to bring that out of me.”

“Take care, Ulrin.”

“You too, Gerevin. Be safe out there.”

With that, the brothers parted ways once more, but now as equals. Both had their journeys ahead of them.

And their toughest challenges were yet to come.`,

      content: `“Another caravan arrived this morning, prince,” Captain Larias declared in his afternoon report. “Eight men, all of working age and fit. Four young women. Three children.”

“That puts us up past three hundred now, doesn’t it?” Ulrin inquired.

“Yes, prince. Three hundred and two, including children.”

“We’re cutting it dangerously close to the limits of our food production, then,” Ulrin continued. “We can raise just enough for three hundred sustainably, according to the last estimate I saw.”

“Actually, we are looking to revise that number. One of the farmers who joined us last week is an expert on mushrooms and had a whole box of them we could use for their spores. Things might be tight for a little while, but once they start growing, with all their uses, we estimate we’ll have the nutrition to support another fifty.”

Ulrin nodded. “Be sure to give that farmer my personal thanks and that he has everything he needs to grow his mushroom farm as quickly and efficiently as possible.”

“Yes, sir.”

Though the strain on their food and other supplies was a constant worry, Ulrin actually viewed it as a happy problem. He was surprised there were this many people still left alive in Lorn, and they were all finding their way here.

“How are our defenses? Did the new arrivals come into any trouble?”

Captain Larias stiffened. “The Corrupted have been poking around the routes again. They’re not stupid, despite how they act, and they know people are frequently moving through. But our boys have been successful in keeping them at bay. The road was clear when the caravan came through.”

“Well done, captain. Dismissed.”

Ulrin let himself go lax as soon as Larias was out of sight. Putting on the act of being a knowledgeable and commanding prince was exhausting. Even if he was technically a prince, giving orders and getting reports did not sit right with him.

But he had a responsibility to keep the act up, even if he was really just a figurehead for all of Bayliff’s ideas.

It was Bayliff who had led the charge on getting the castle ready to support survivors. Bayliff who had crafted and set off fireworks every week to lead survivors to the castle. He was the one who mapped out the routes the survivors would likely take to reach the castle and plotted how those routes would be best defended. And it was Bayliff who had led the charge in making the castle self-sustaining in terms of food and water. Basically, while everyone looked up to Ulrin, the “Last Prince of Lorn,” as they liked to call him, it was the scholar who was responsible for the growth and survival of the population.

As Ulrin looked out at the castle grounds from his parapet, he couldn’t help but be amazed at what they had accomplished in just a year. When they had gotten started, Ulrin would not have been surprised to learn that less than a dozen people were alive in the whole kingdom. Now, they were at three hundred. Three hundred safe, sheltered, and fed. And they worked every day to make this place more livable, more comfortable. It had become a true haven in the darkness.

The people of Lorn could truly survive anything. Ulrin was full of pride.

But he also knew that he could not remain there forever. The more time passed, the more his thoughts drifted to the border and to Gerevin. He had hoped to one day receive word from his brother that he had discovered some secret about The Bleeding or had formed some plan to defeat the Corrupted once and for all. But he had not had a hint about Gerevin since the day he had left.

Ulrin grew restless, just as his brother knew he would.

All of this, everything they had accomplished, was amazing but also temporary. One day they would run out of space, or the Corrupted would gather in too big a number, or something would befall their supplies. This was not a permanent solution. Ulrin wasn’t sure if there was such a thing as a permanent solution, but if there was one, it would probably involve whatever Gerevin was doing.

That was why Ulrin had decided to leave. He had already made arrangements. Captain Larias, as competent a military officer as one could hope to find, would find orders to take charge in his absence, with a promise that Ulrin would return after a while. He sincerely hoped he would be able to fulfill that promise.

All that was left was to sneak out.

This turned out to be more difficult than he had expected, as that night, he found Cryaliss, Bayliff, and Larias, all awaiting him at the drawbridge.

“Going somewhere, prince?” Bayliff asked.

Caught red-handed, Ulrin did not know what to say. “I was just going to stretch my legs.”

Captain Larias held up the note containing his orders. “Seems like you were planning quite a stretch.”

Ulrin shrugged. “In fairness, you were not supposed to find that until the morning.”

Cryaliss sighed. “Really, Ulrin? Whatever were you thinking? If you go anywhere, you know you have to take me with you. I have to treat your Blud regularly, or you’ll be Corrupted.”

“I guess that’s true,” Ulrin admitted. “I wasn’t really looking forward to hunting animals for their blood.”

Bayliff put a finger to his chin. “And if there’s some grand discovery to be made in Irimire regarding the nature of the Corruption, you are going to need my mind. I am the only one who would have any chance of understanding it, after all.”

“So, wait. You’re not trying to stop me. You want to go with me?” Ulrin asked.

“I’ve already briefed the men that you three will be leaving for some time on a mission to stop the Corruption,” Larias said. “Everyone down to the last man has complete faith in you, prince. We have not forgotten what you have done for us, that you’ve given us hope and lives when everything seemed lost. If anyone can find a way to save what remains of this world, we know it will be you. We’ll hold down the castle while you are gone, don’t worry. Succeed or fail, it will be here when you return.”

Ulrin did not know how to respond to such lofty expectations. “Thank you, captain. I know you’ll do a fine job in our absence.”

“Don’t touch the stuff in my lab, though,” Bayliff added. “Unless you’re looking to lose a finger.”

With one last salute, Larias returned to the castle, leaving the three of them to begin their next adventure.

Ulrin took out the Pathfinder and set it on the border with Irimire.

“Who knows what we will face when we cross the border?” Ulrin said. “Things might be even worse there than they are in Lorn. If you have any doubts, now’s your chance to remain here in safety.”

“I’m with you, Ulrin,” Cryaliss replied. “To the end.”

“Oh, please. Like you have any chance without me,” Bayliff said.

Ulrin grinned at his companions, feeling more like himself than he had in a long time. “Then let’s get going. We’ll get to the bottom of all this madness.”

Three set off into the darkness, hoping they would be the ones to find how to restore the light.

None would return.`,
