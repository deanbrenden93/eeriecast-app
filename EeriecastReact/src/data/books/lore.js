      content: `Looking down all he can see is an ocean of pines and firs. Other species are scattered about but their breeds escape him. Besides, they are all whipping by in a blur, the forest a canopy of musty greens beneath him. He is flying over it all and he feels that if he reached down, he might feel the very tops of those pines, the needles poking his fingertips, grazing his skin.

But he can’t reach down. Not consciously. Because even as he watches the blur of that musty green passing below him, Chris knows this is a dream. He’s aware of it in a subconscious way that his mind doesn’t bother to analyze. He knows this is a dream because he’s had it nearly twenty times before.

He doesn’t know what the dream means, only that it feels like a premonition of danger. Peering down into that forest, he senses something dark, something waiting. There is something evil down there, lurking in the shadows of the trees cast down by the setting sun. But is the sun actually setting, or is it melting? Dissolving? Is the darkness he senses down on that forest floor so cunning and vile that it has somehow destroyed the sun?

In the dream, it’s easy to imagine this is so. Enveloped in fear, Chris feels himself starting to descend. He is no longer floating, but falling slowly. His face is nicked and scratched and cut as he falls. Sticks gouge his eyes and pine needles slip into his ears, between his lips.

During it all, he is not worried about breaking his back or fracturing his skull on the ground at the end of the fall. He is more worried about what else waits down there in the darkness, among the trees and vastness of the forest.

If he does fall all the way to the ground, he can only hope the impact alone will kill him before that living darkness finds him.

Chris falls and falls, trees sailing by like rockets, and just before he hits the waiting forest floor, everything goes black and the dream is gone.

And in the early morning hours, this feels like both a blessing and a curse.

---

He had the dream so often that it barely bothered him as he sat at the table, eating breakfast. He was tired because it had taken forever to fall back to sleep, but the dream itself was just an afterthought. The sting of hot coffee filling his mouth, he poked at his bowl of Frosted Mini-Wheats and watched his daughter, Brianna, slurping up her Apple Jacks.

Behind him, his wife was making a smoothie in the blender. The blender sounded like a helicopter taking off from their roof and did very little to brighten Chris’s morning. He was of the opinion that this particular blender was among the most annoying sounds in the world. It had the volume of an evacuation siren. But he knew better than to say anything. Vicki was all about her smoothies lately and, as she’d told him numerous times, some noise in the morning and some expensive fruits and veggies throughout the week were worth her keeping a twenty-year-old figure at the age of forty-one. Chris supposed she was right. She’d been working out and eating extremely healthy for about three months now, and it was showing.

Not that it mattered. They hadn’t slept together in about three weeks and whenever he even suggested it, she somehow turned it on him. She claimed it was all he wanted—just sex and someone to make dinner. And really, on the days when he came home after wrapping up a fourteen- or fifteen-hour day at work, she was sort of right.

She’d bemoaned it for so long that he was starting to wonder if it was becoming his base reaction to most things. They’d been married for fifteen years and it had taken them only two of those years to discover that aside from sex and a mutual love of the San Francisco 49ers, they didn’t have much in common. So once sex was off the table (or at least denoted to a once every three- or four-weeks obligation), Chris felt he wasn’t left with much.

There was also the fact that he was pretty sure Vicki was having an affair. He hadn’t asked her yet because he wasn’t absolutely sure, but all signs pointed that way. He had plenty of reasons to assume so, but they were all too heavy and depressing to consider over an already stale and depressing breakfast.

And besides, he would never confront her unless he had hard, irrefutable proof.

“Anything big at school today?” Chris asked Brianna.

His eight-year-old daughter nodded as she crunched her cereal. “Spelling test. And kickball in gym class!”

“That sounds like fun. The kickball. Not the spelling test.”

“I’m a good speller!”

“I know you are. You’re good at whatever they throw you at school according to the work you bring home.”

Brianna smiled proudly. Behind them, Vicki started up the blender again. To her credit, she’d waited for a break in the conversation. When she was done about fifteen seconds later, Chris looked back at his daughter.

“Remember, when you get back home from school today, I won’t be here.”

“I know. You’re leaving for your trip.”

“That’s right. And you’re not going to be sad, right? You’re going to listen to your mother while I’m gone, right?”

“Right,” she said, giving a smile that was eerily just like Vicki’s go-to smile. When she hit fifteen or sixteen, Briana was going to look exactly like her mother. Chris was fully expecting a revolving door of suitors.

Chris returned her smile as he finished up his cereal. He took the bowl to the sink and gave Vicki a playful tap on the butt as he passed her by. She was pouring her bright green smoothie from the blender into a glass. She did not respond in any way to his playful gesture—not that he’d expected anything.

“You sure you’re still okay with the trip?” he asked.

“For the fifth time, yes. Besides… if I said no, what are you going to do? Call your cretin friends and tell them you can’t go because your mean wife said you had to stay home?” She turned to him, sipping from her smoothie. “It’s okay, Chris. Go. Have fun. You work very hard for this family and you deserve the time away.”

He thought it might feel like a sweet sentiment if he wasn’t assuming that Vicki would use these next five days to enjoy the affair, he was sure she was having. He already knew that Brianna was staying with a friend Saturday night for a sleepover. The equation suddenly started to sink into his brain like acid, and he was all but certain that this was exactly what would happen. You suspect your wife of sleeping around and you’re leaving for five days. You’re some kind of genius, that’s for sure.

Chris pushed all of that away. He couldn’t just assume, even though the evidence was staggering. He was the type of guy that would never even make such a suggestion unless he walked in on Vicki with her lover actively engaged in the act. And even then, he’d feel awkward about confronting her because he hated conflict and, honestly, he wondered if he had pushed her to it. Also, at this point, he wasn’t even sure if he’d even care or not. In his eyes, the arguing and fighting afterwards would be worse than accepting the affair.

Maybe his trip out into the Alaskan wilderness would bring some clarity. Maybe the five days away from her would prove to him how much he loved and needed her. Or, alternatively, maybe it would show him how much he didn’t miss her when they were apart.

Either way, he could use some clarity.

His phone dinged beside him. It was a text from work—a nurse texting with a question about how the doctor filling in for him should catalogue notes about ADHD prescriptions. He answered it, finding that he would probably miss his work more than he would miss Vicki. He’d been a pediatrician with Aspen Hills Pediatrics for seven years now, and each year got more and more rewarding. Chris hadn’t missed more than three days straight since he’d gone to a pediatrician’s conference in Las Vegas last year.

Moments after answering that text, he got another one. This one was from his friend, Bobby. It was simple and straight to the point: Where the hell are you?

Apparently, Bobby was in a hurry. But Chris was going to at least see Brianna to the bus before he left. So, he finished up his breakfast and walked alongside his daughter as she readied for school. Shoes, tied. Bookbag, packed. Hair, done in a far-too-cute-ponytail. He could feel Vicki watch him closely as he helped. He wondered if she was simply biding her time, waiting impatiently for him to leave.

Chris and Brianna exited through the front door and walked down the sidewalk. The bus stop was along the curb at the end of the street, where it picked up Brianna and two other neighborhood kids. Starting down the street hand-in-hand, Chris saw that the two other kids had already joined together a few houses down. Their northern California neighborhood was quiet and peaceful almost every morning, but Chris thought it seemed a bit more serene than usual this morning. Probably just because he was so anxious to get going so he and his friends could make it to the airport without having to worry about missing their flight. Thinking of the chaos of the airport would make any well-to-do neighborhood seem overly quiet.

“I’ll miss you, squirt,” Chris said.

“I’ll miss you, too,” Brianna said, giving him a hug. He loved that she wasn’t old enough to not want to hug him out in public. From what he understood, he might have another year or two of that left. “You’ll be home Tuesday night, right?” she asked.

“That’s right. But it’ll be so late that you won’t see me until Wednesday morning.”

“Well, come give me snuggles when you get in anyway, okay?”

“Of course.”

He stood there with her, listening to her tell him about her friends at school and all the seven-year-old-girl drama that was taking place in the lunchroom. He gave her a receptive ear until the bus came creeping by. Chris gave her one final kiss on the forehead before she got on the bus. The door closed behind her and he watched the bus inch further down the street.

When he turned back to the house, he saw that Vicki was already coming out of the front door. She had her purse over her shoulder and keys in hand. He met her between the front door and the car they parked in the driveway because the garage was so filled with clutter.

“Trying to sneak off without saying goodbye?” Chris asked. He said it as a joke, but wondered if this might have been exactly what she’d been trying to do.

“No. But it’s going to be a busy day and since I have to leave early to get Brianna off the bus, I’m going to try to get started early.”

“Okay. And hey…thanks for letting me do this. I know it seems sort of juvenile.”

“Of course, Chris. You need time away, to blow off some steam. I get it.” She smiled thinly and added: “And yes, it is a little juvenile.”

There was something else on his tongue, something he almost let out at the last minute. “So, who have you been sleeping with? Who will you be spending Saturday night with while I’m away and Brianna is at her sleepover?”

Of course, it would not be the best time. So, instead, he gave her a brief kiss on the corner of her mouth. “See you Tuesday night.”

She nodded and said: “Be safe, and don’t do anything stupid. I know how you can be when you get around them.”

She was in the car before he could argue. He stepped back and watched her leave. She gave a cute, obligatory wave before pulling away down the street. Chris stood there for only a moment, feeling that the morning had fallen flat somehow. He’d be gone for five days, gone to explore the Alaskan wilderness and to try some ice fishing for the first time in his life—just one of many items on his bucket list.

He’d already tossed his two bags into the trunk of their second car last night, so there was no need to go back inside. But he did so anyway, telling himself it was for a second cup of coffee. Yet he only stood in the kitchen, looking around and trying to figure out where his life had gone. At forty-one years of age, it seemed to have started unspooling quickly; the years lost in the shadow of youthful memories that were already starting to fade.

He was numb to it, really. And that’s why he felt nothing when he left the house, locking the door behind him, and heading for his car…all but certain his wife was cheating on him and that when he returned, nothing about his home or his life would be the same.`,

      content: `Noah Miller lived just five blocks over from Chris, yet his kid, a ten-year-old boy, took a different bus to school. Chris got stuck behind that particular bus on his way to Noah’s house. When he parked in front of the Miller residence, Chris was just in time to see Noah kissing his wife goodbye. He wished the sight of it made him embarrassed, but it really just made him envious. Noah and Catherine Miller had been married for seventeen years and Chris had never heard Noah say a single cross word about her. They still held hands and tickled one another sporadically, even in front of friends.

Chris wondered what it might feel like to have a spouse that actually missed you when you were gone. But that led down a road of ideas and notions that he was not going to obsess over on this trip. So, he busied himself with his phone, answering another text from work, as he waited for Noah to properly say goodbye to Catherine.

When Noah came to the car, Chris popped the trunk for him. Noah tossed in his two bags with the care of a man that never really had to pack to go anywhere. With a strong thud, the trunk shut and seconds later Noah landed in the passenger seat with a look of excitement in his eyes. Whereas Chris was physically fit and was always teased by his friends as being “attractive to the point of being potentially gay,” Noah was slightly overweight. Also, though Chris knew Noah was quite attentive to his hygiene, he always looked as if he badly needed to wash his hair.

Today, his long black hair was tucked behind his ears, making him look a few years younger than his actual age of thirty-nine. He had a hip vibe around him at all times, the sort of husband and father that listened to Radiohead and was into gourmet coffees rather than 80s hair bands and tinkering with old cars out in the garage.

“Did Bobby text you yet?” Noah asked.

“Yeah. First thing this morning.”

“I figured we’d have to wake him up to get him going,” Noah said. “Maybe his texting you is a good sign.”

“Let’s go see,” Chris said. “If I’m being honest, though, I was hoping to have to splash some cold water in his face.”

Chris and Noah were close enough that they didn’t have to fill silences with meaningless chit-chat. They rode the half a mile to Bobby Valencia’s house without saying a word, though Noah sang quietly to a John Mellencamp song that came on the radio.

One of the many inside jokes always hovering around their group of four friends was how awful it must be for Vicki Ramsey and Catherine Miller that Chris, Noah, and Bobby lived so close to one another. Chris and Noah lived within the same subdivision, the sort of neighborhood where most of the houses and yards looked the same, right down to the POA-approved fences. Bobby, whom had never married and had no plans to ever do so, lived just outside of the subdivision, in an apartment he could barely afford. Chris still wasn’t exactly sure how Bobby could afford to go on this trip, but had not dared ask. He was pretty sure it had a lot to do with the large sum of money that Bobby inherited when his father died last year.

When Chris and Noah arrived at Bobby’s apartment building, they both went inside to fetch him. They passed by a few people on their way to work. Chris realized just how freeing it felt to know that these people were on their way to work, and the kids were on their way to school, while he was about to go off on an unnecessary little trip. No responsibilities, no expectations. It wasn’t something he got to experience often…hardly ever, in fact.

They walked to the stairwell just off the lobby and took the stairs up to the third floor. There, they came to Bobby’s apartment and hammered on his door, taking turns in an almost childlike sort of way.

They could hear Bobby inside, cursing them out for banging so damned loud, though this only fueled their delight. When he finally answered, it was apparent to Chris that Bobby had enjoyed one of his late nights out, he looked tired and was rubbing at his temples.

“Who taught you miserable jerks to knock on a door like that?” Bobby groaned.

“Hey, you were blowing up my phone this morning,” Noah replied. “I figured you’d already be ready.”

“I am. Just waiting for this friggin’ Tylenol to kick in.”

“Long night?”

“Not too long. I was in bed by midnight. Plenty of sleep. It was the amount of drinking I did that’s the problem.”

At thirty-seven, Bobby was the youngest of their group. It was Chris’s assumption that Bobby was one of those men that saw turning forty as a death-sentence. He was trying to live up as much of his life as he could before he hit that mark. That usually included hanging out in bars occupied by people ten or fifteen years younger than him. And somehow, Bobby managed to hang hard with that crowd. He also somehow managed to pick up women much younger than him on a fairly consistent basis—and occasionally, women a bit older as well. While he wasn’t good-looking by any sort of movie-star standards, he had a weird sort of charm to him. It had been the case ever since Chris met him in middle school. Vicki had once said that Bobby reminded her of John Cusack when he was younger—and if John Cusack was a raging dickhead.

“Well, let’s get this show on the road already,” Bobby said, leaning against the doorframe. He picked up the bookbag and the single suitcase he had placed by the door. “What are you pansies waiting for?”

The trio headed out to the car, Bobby eagerly taking the back seat so he could stretch out a bit. He looked at his Apple Watch and groaned. “Hell, do we still have to pick up Bear?”

“Yeah,” Noah said. “He’s going, too…or did you forget?”

“No, I didn’t forget. But that means we’re going to be late.”

“No, he’s meeting us at the airport,” Chris said as he weaved back out onto the main street that led out of town and to the interstate. “He couldn’t get the day off of work.”

“What?” Bobby said. “He teaches seventh graders about verbs and nouns. They couldn’t get a sub?”

“Don’t know,” Chris said. “He only has two classes on Fridays, though. He’ll meet us with plenty of time to catch the flight.”

As Chris checked the rearview to gauge Bobby’s expression, a thought occurred to him. Hadn’t Bobby been hungover the last time they’d hung out? And the time before that had been at a cookout over at Noah’s house, where he’d pounded at least a six-pack on his own. Yes, it was perfectly fine to drink and enjoy yourself, but Chris felt that it was another thing entirely to have to drink in order to function. Chris couldn’t help but wonder if his friend of more than twenty-five years was tight-roping a line that they were all just choosing to ignore.

“So, the ball and chains were okay with you boys heading off to Alaska for a few days?” Bobby teased from the back.

“You kidding?” Noah said. “Catherine is going to Los Angeles for the weekend to hang out with her sister. She’s thrilled that I’m leaving.”

Chris knew this wasn’t strictly the case. He had, after all, seen them kissing like eager teenagers when he’d stopped to pick Noah up.

“And I think Vicki needed the break from me, too,” Chris said, hoping to leave it at that. His friends knew that he and Vicki were in a funk as of late, but it wasn’t a conversation they’d gone deep on. They were close, but not that close. And that was perfectly fine with Chris.

Thankfully, the hour and forty-minute drive to the airport consisted of the usual conversations. Football, movies, exaggerated stories about how they’d all partied hard in their twenties, the current state of American politics, and a few excited speculations about how their trip into the Alaskan wilderness might go.

“Have either of you actually ice fished before?” Bobby asked from the back.

“Once,” Noah said. “I was a kid, though. Visiting an uncle in Minnesota. It was boring as hell.”

“Then I’m so glad we’re spending all this money to do it in Alaska.” Chris said.

“It’s going to be great. I like to think I have more of an appreciation for nature now.”

“Same,” Bobby said. “Plus, now you’re old enough to drink beer. And doesn’t that make just about everything better?”

“This is true.”

“Just make sure we don’t end up pulling your drunk ass out of a frozen lake,” Chris said, eyeing Bobby in the rearview.

“I make no promises,” Bobby jested.

It was exchanges like these that made Chris certain they’d have a great time. Sure, Bobby was a little much to handle at times, and there had been sideline discussions among Chris, Noah, and Bear if they should even invite him at all, but maybe the trip would do him some good. Chris knew their little group wasn’t exactly the sort to stage an intervention, so he was hoping an uninterrupted expanse of nature might help do the trick.

Or maybe you stop thinking about other people’s problems and focus on your own, he thought. Don’t you think you might be singling Bobby out for his drinking so you can avoid the fact that you don’t trust your wife and your marriage is going down the toilet?

It was a good point, and it instantly took his mind away from Bobby’s drinking problem. It also made him wonder if the Alaskan wilderness might do for him what he hoped it would do for Bobby: maybe it would bring him clarity, too. Maybe he’d return home with a renewed heart and revived interest in his marriage.

There was no telling what sort of experience awaited them out there, and that, he supposed, was worth the journey.`,

      content: `When Barret “Bear” Thompson met them at the airport, Chris, Noah, and Bobby were at one of the airport bars. Chris was typically not one to drink before five in the afternoon—especially not at airport bar prices—but he was starting to see this trip as a vacation of sorts. And when he was on vacation, all the rules changed. He disliked flying, which made the situation worse. They had two flights ahead: one from Sacramento to Anchorage, and another on a small prop plane to their remote cabin in the woods.

Bear took the seat next to Noah and ordered a beer. There was something about Bear that shifted the dynamic of the group a bit. He levelled them out in a way Chris had always felt but had not been able to clearly understand. In the past, over beers and games of poker or watching the 49ers, they’d come to the conclusion that their little group could be neatly divided, as if they were the cast in a cheesy movie.

Chris was the responsible one, nearly to the point of being boring—but in the movie, it would be considered a cute quirk. Noah was the passionate one, the guy that got deeply obsessed with whatever project he was working on while maintaining a very strong marriage. Bobby was the screw-up, by his own admission; he was the guy who could not hold a job, had a penchant for drinking, and still tried to party like a twenty-year-old. Then there was Bear. One look at him and a stranger might assume he was a grizzled outdoorsman. He was a massive man, standing at six and a half feet tall and weighing two-fifty, most of it being muscle and beard. And while he did know a thing or two about the great outdoors, he had a kind heart that betrayed his appearance. On occasion, Chris had heard Vicki refer to Bear as the Brawny Man, referencing the character in the plaid shirt carrying an axe on the wrapper of Bounty paper towels.

When Bear took a seat at the bar and started drinking from his beer, the mood changed for the better. If there was tension there before, it was now gone. Bear was just that sort of guy.

“This our first round?” Bear asked.

“Yeah, and the only one,” Chris said. “The plane leaves in half an hour.”

“To hell with that,” Bobby said. He made a dramatic showing of draining his current beer and tapping the glass on the edge of the car. “Another, please,” he sang to the bartender.

Chris looked to Noah and Bear to see if he was the only one this had annoyed and apparently, he was. Maybe he was too concerned about Bobby’s drinking. Maybe he was making a bigger deal of it than it needed to be. Or, like he’d touched upon in the car on the way to the airport, maybe it was his way of deflecting his own problems.

Chris remained mostly quiet while his three friends talked amongst themselves. He studied Bobby as much as he could without seeming obvious. Perhaps, Chris thought, there was a part of him that envied Bobby. To be thirty-seven and still out on the bar scene, somehow regularly bedding twenty-five-year-old women, obviously had its allure. Sure, Bobby had never had a stable job for more than two years and the idea of commitment scared the hell out of him, but there was something appealing about that kind of freedom. The inconsistent paychecks and no real hope of a career seemed to be more than worth it to Bobby. When he wasn’t hung over, he seemed to be in a good mood most of the time.

Chris finished his beer and the bartender was there right away. “Another?” she asked.

“No, thanks.” Though, really…would it be so bad to have a bit of a buzz on the plane? Maybe catch a quick booze-induced nap?

Nope. Something about the mere idea of being woozy during a flight terrified him.

Moments later, the speakers above them notified them that their plane was now boarding. They quickly paid their tab, Bobby quickly polishing off the rest of his second drink. They then walked single file towards their gate, one right behind the other. It was all smooth and without hiccups. Four men travelling to the wilderness for five days, didn’t require much luggage. They’d each managed to pack everything they needed into their one allowed checked bag and a single carry-on. And everything they’d need for their adventures were already waiting for them at the cabin.

The flight wasn’t very crowded at all, and their seats were all together. As they settled in while the remaining passengers boarded, Chris saw that Bear had already taken out a book for the flight. Bear was forever buried in a book, usually some sort of political thriller or mystery. For a guy who taught middle school English, he tended to hate the classics, something Chris gave him a hard time for.

Chris’s seat was by the window, and he watched the runway disappear as the plane took off. He then watched the earth get smaller and smaller, buildings becoming only squares, the vehicles on the highways nothing more than busy specks. It reminded him of his dream, sailing over a gorgeous yet somehow darkly tinged forest.

Noah was beside him, sitting rigidly in his seat as the plane finished its ascent. “You okay, man?” He nudged Chris gently, also taking a peek out of the window.

“Yeah. Just home stuff.” Chris replied, sensing the distance in his voice.

“Did Vicki not want you coming out here?”

“Nah, she was fine with it. It’s just the same old, same old with her right now.”

Noah nodded and remained quiet. They knew each other well enough to know when to stop talking about something. Chris and Noah, being the tightest of the group, could read this in one another with eerie clarity. Friends since their Sophomore year of college at UCLA, they secretly saw themselves as the glue that held their little tribe together.

When the plane levelled out, Noah took out his phone and earbuds and started listening to something. Probably one of those true crime podcasts he seemed to be favoring these days. As for Chris, he continued to stare out of the window, watching the clouds coast by, and unable to escape the fact that he felt like he was running away from his problems at home.

---

Two hours and fifteen minutes later, the cooler air of the North Pacific created some rough turbulence. Bobby was on his second gin and tonic and, by Chris’s estimation, had a pretty good buzz going. It was almost comical, watching Bobby try to place the glass to his lips while the plane rattled about. He was going to be either incredibly hilarious or irritating as hell for the remainder of their journey—a trek that would take them from the Anchorage airport to their cabin in the remote wilderness, about twenty-five miles away from the stain-on-the-map town of Birch.

Shortly after the turbulence, the pilot announced that they would be beginning their descent into Anchorage. After the announcement, Noah removed his headphones and gave Chris another nudge.

“Bobby’s going to be a handful, huh?”

“Yeah, I’m thinking so,” Chris said. “I’m glad I’m not the only one that sees it coming.”

“Look at Bear. He already looks irritated.”

Chris had not noticed this. Though, when he looked across the aisle to where Bear and Bobby were sitting side by side, Bear did seem to be annoyed, his face tight with an aggravated expression that had been nowhere in sight when he’d joined them at the airport.

“I plan on ignoring him when he gets drunk,” Noah said. “Notice I said when, not if. Because you know he will.”

“So, it’ll be the same as back home, then,” Chris said. “Just colder and without wives.”

They remained quiet until the plane landed on the runway fifteen minutes later. No one seemed to be in a particular hurry to get off of the plane, so the four friends milled slowly through the aisle until they stepped off on the airbridge. Bobby seemed to be waking perfectly fine and wasn’t loud when speaking with those he passed, so maybe it wouldn’t be as bad as Chris was thinking.

Stepping off of the airbridge and into the airport, Chris looked at Bear, knowing that this was where he would truly start to show his true personality. There was an agenda and a schedule. There were places they needed to be and a timeframe to be adhered to. While Beare would never claim he was the most responsible of the group (Chris usually got that distinction), he was definitely the most organized and forward-thinking.

“We’re supposed to meet our van in ten minutes, on the curb out front,” Bear’s words affirmed Chris’s suspicions. “So, if you need a bathroom break or something to eat, get to it now.”

There was an exchange of silent glances, they decided to play it safe and all made a rush to the restroom before walking outside. Standing just outside the main doors, it surprised Chris to find that it wasn’t quite as cold as he’d been expecting. There was a chill to the air, yes, but it lacked the bite he’d been preparing himself for.

The four of them stood just outside of the airport for a few seconds before Bear pointed to their left. “Blue van, right there.” He started walking without even checking to see if they were following. They were though, except for Noah, who had paused for a moment to tie his shoe, had to scramble to catch up to them.

The driver was standing outside of the van—a modest blue shuttle-type of van that looked to be several years old. He opened the sliding side door for them and greeted them with a smile. The driver looked to be in his early thirties or so, with dark hair and a beard and moustache that perfectly framed his face.

“Heading to Delaney Park Airfield, correct?”

“That’s right,” Bear said, stepping into the van.

Chris got in next, followed by Bobby and then Noah. When the driver closed the sliding door and dashed around to the front, Bear playfully reached over and slapped Bobby’s knee.

“Hot damn boys, we’re actually doing it!” Bear exclaimed.

Bobby gave his usual emphatic cheer of joy, a roar usually reserved for intense sporting events or the opening of another six pack of beer. Chris and Noah were a little more reserved, giving a little smattering of applause, a few “whoo”s and“yeah”s.

The driver opened the front door and slid in behind the wheel. “You gentlemen ready?”

He got the same response from the four friends, an enthusiastic round of cheers. With that, the driver started the van and pulled out into airport traffic, officially starting their adventure.`,

      content: `“You’ve got to be kidding me, right?”

Bobby asked this question as the four friends stepped out of the van and looked across the faded tarmac of Delaney Park Airfield. They were all looking at the same thing: a rugged little prop plane that looked as if it had been made out of a cardboard kit by a careless five-year-old. Even to Chris’s untrained eyes, he could see where the left wing had been recently repaired. The plane’s nose looked like it was crafted from a cereal box, and it didn’t seem big enough to accommodate all of them.

As they stared at their next mode of transportation, the blue van from the airport sped away behind them. Chris thought it looked as if the driver was in a hurry to get out of there—like he had just dropped them off at the foot of some elaborate joke.

“Oh, it’s not that bad,” Bear said, though even his tone was a little off. “Where’s your sense of adventure?”

“I left it in the van,” Noah said. “It’s currently headed back to the airport.”

Bear started walking across the tarmac, and the others reluctantly followed. To the right, back at the rear of the little airstrip, Chris saw the control tower. It looked to be in better shape than their plane, but not by much. The entire place looked like one of those dilapidated third world airports he sometimes saw in action movies. But none of them were action heroes, and nothing about this felt glamorous or adventurous. Looking back to the plane, Chris started to feel foolish and just a tiny bit uneasy.

As they drew closer to the plane, the door to the cockpit opened up and a man leaped out. He was a light-skinned African American, wearing a denim jacket over a black shirt. He wore jeans with old work boots, looking like he was about to head out to a bar somewhere with Bobby rather than fly four Californians out to the Alaskan wilderness. Chris felt his nerves start to flare up and the unease was slowly creeping toward fear.

“You the Barrett party?” the pilot asked.

“Yeah, that’s us,” Bear answered.

“Barrett party, coffin for five,” Bobby said quietly, miming a waiter.

They all had a laugh at this. Even Bear let a laugh trickle out from the center of his beard as he gave Bobby a dirty glance.

Bear greeted the pilot with a handshake. “I won’t lie, man…the planes on your website look a lot better than this thing.”

“Oh, for sure,” the pilot said. “But we’re going to Birch, and the nicer planes can’t land on that little strip of field they have out there. But this beauty,” he said, slapping the side of the plane, “can land anywhere. She’s a trusty one. You have my word.”

Chris shrugged and headed for the plane. The pilot opened up the cabin doors and pulled down a little stepladder that had been installed in a small compartment under the floor. “Dying in a fiery plane crash out in the Alaskan wilderness might not be such a bad way to go,” Chris said.

“Me, I’d rather not go anywhere just yet,” Noah said. “Despite what my Carpel tunnel and bad back have to say about it, I’m still young.”

As Chris started up the little stepladder, the pilot gave a nod of approval. He then extended his hand and said, “The name’s Jay.”

“Good to meet you,” Chris said. “Jay, how long have you been flying?”

“Four years. Been up in ol’ Sally over one hundred times and never had a problem.”

“Sally?” Chris asked, climbing the little ladder and getting inside.

“It carries me around, puts up with my cursing and bad behavior. So I figured I needed to give it woman’s name.”

Bobby came up next, starting for the ladder. “Wise man,” he said, clapping Jay on the shoulder.

Noah and Bear followed, Bear bringing up the rear and somehow managing to squeeze himself in. The plane shifted noticeably when Bear got in. Chris had taken the front seat next to Jay, as he’d been the first in the plane. Bear, Noah, and Bobby were crammed into the rear passenger seat, which stretched from one side of the plane to the other. They’d tossed all of their luggage in the compartment behind the seat within the plane’s tail.

Jay started the plane’s engine and Chris was delighted to hear that it not only came to life at once, but that it sounded quite strong. While he’d never heard the engine of a small prop plane before, it sounded powerful enough to make him feel confident that he may not die in a plane crash after all. He glanced back to his friends as Jay began to pull the plane forward. Bobby was pretty much bouncing with nervousness and anticipation.

Being Chris’s first time in a small plane, he couldn’t help but feel like a child on his first roller-coaster. For the second time that day, he watched the earth fall away as he was lifted up. Only this time, it was much more majestic.

As Jay piloted them away from the small airfield, the trees and open expanses of land took over instantly. Chris wasn’t sure he’d ever seen so many shades of green. They cascaded by as the plane headed northwest. Off in the distance were rolling hills that were so high they might very well be considered a mountain range; Chris had no idea, as he had not researched the area thoroughly after Bear had booked the trip. There was a scattering of snow on the large hills, but hardly any on the nearby trees. Everything seemed green, aside from the stray bit of creeks and streams.

The trees grew so close together that there was no clear space between them; the forest floor was dark and unseen beneath them. Many looked like spruces or pines, though there were smaller varieties hidden in there among all of that green. Some of the dark greens were so dominant that it looked nearly black, standing out as green only when the shadow of the plane broke it up.

“So, heading to Birch,” Jay said, as friendly as could be. “Ice fishing, I take it?”

“Yeah,” Bear said excitedly. “It’s supposed to be easy up there, right?”

“Depends on the time of the year…and your definition of easy. But you’re here at the perfect time. The ice on the lake isn’t too thick, and the fish are almost always biting.”

“I don’t see much snow down there,” Noah pointed out. The plane’s powerful engine forced everyone to speak a little louder in order to be heard.

“Won’t matter. Birch is another half an hour away by plane. When you step out into the open air, you’re going to gasp at the difference in temperature. It’s crazy. Maupin Lake, which I’m assuming is where you guys are headed, stays frozen over just about every day of the year on its western rim.”

“Yeah, that’s where we’re staying. In a cabin out by the western corner of Maupin Lake.”

Jay nodded and smiled. “Well, this may be the last time I see you fellas, then.”

“That is not a joke to make on a plane that looks like ol’ Sally,” Bobby shouted.

“Yeah, what do you mean?” Bear said.

Jay was still smiling, looking expertly out to the sky and the forest below. “Nah, just messing with you. Out there on the western edge of Maupin Lake, you’ll be staying in an area of the woods that gets the brunt of a lot of ghost stories. Fairytale-type stuff, you know?”

“Are we talking Big Bad Wolf fairytales or hot princesses stranded in towers?” Bobby asked, snickering.

“Neither. The woods up there are thick, and it gets damned cold. People that don’t know what they’re doing tend to get disoriented and lost. That part of most of the stories is true and absolutely not made up. Happens all the time. I even had to fly out a few times last year to help rescue some folks and take them to the little emergency rescue stations speckled all over the woods. But because of that, some of the locals in Birch blame it on old Yupik spirits.”

“Yupik?” Chris asked.

Bear answered before Jay had a chance to, showing that he had researched the area. “The Yupik were some of the native locals before the land was properly settled. Them, the Inuit, a few others.”

“Nerd,” Bobby said, nudging Bear in the ribs.

“He’s right, though,” Jay said. “There aren’t many of them around…just a few families in Birch, I think. They mostly live in Canada, from what I know. But yeah, you’ll probably hear about some of those legends when you get into Birch. Stories about Yupik spirits, the wendigo, demons in the trees. Even fairies, believe it or not.”

Behind Chris, Bear and Bobby were bickering harmlessly. Noah peered out of the window, enthralled with all of the nature passing by. Meanwhile, Chris stared down into those trees, thinking of how easy it might be to get stranded out there.

It also did not escape his attention that as he watched the trees roll by in a beautiful tapestry, the scene was almost identical to the dream he’d been having lately. It was so similar, undeniably eerie. And when a chill crept across his body, he tried to convince himself it was just the temperature dropping slightly all around them.`,

      content: `The airfield in Birch made the one at Delaney Park look extravagant. The airfield was nothing more than a smooth expanse of asphalt that gave way to dirt. It was surrounded by small, scraggly fields and the same tall trees Chris had been looking at while flying into Birch. There were concrete barriers on both sides of the meager runway, and a one-story building sitting off to the back—what Chris assumed served as traffic control. Seeing the runway come into view was truly the only part of the entire flight into Birch that frightened Chris.

Yet Jay guided ol’ Sally down onto the pitiful-looking runway with expert skill. There was a single, initial jolt of impact and the squelching of the landing gear absorbing the shock, but the landing was otherwise smooth. Something about the successful flight in the old, cramped plane filled Chris was a stirring of excitement that only grew when he stepped down onto the asphalt. It was the most excited he’d been since stepping foot on the plane back in Anchorage—a fitting way to start this uncertain adventure.

Jay pulled as close to the traffic control structure as he could and killed the engine. He then helped them all off of the plane and then hurried around to the back to get their luggage out of the rear hatch.

Nodding to the control building, he said, “The way I understand it, there’s an old SUV parked behind the control tower over there, reserved for all of you.” He even said control tower with a bit of mockery in his voice. “Someone from Benton Rentals out in Birch dropped it off earlier today.”

“Yeah, I checked it out online a few weeks ago,” Bear said. “I’d asked for a rifle, too. Just to keep wolves and things away.”

“What wolves?” Bobby asked. Chris wasn’t sure if he was being serious or doing his best to be irritating.

Ignoring him, Jay nodded. “Yeah, it’s in there, stashed under one of the seats. It should all be spelled out in the paperwork in the glove compartment. I don’t have anything to do with that part of it, but it’s almost always the same with these rentals.”

“Sounds good,” Bear said.

“Birch is a small town, as I’ve said. I got the call from Mr. Benton myself last night. He wanted me to tell you gentlemen, that everything is good to go. When you head back home, just drop the car back off here, with a signed copy of the rental agreement in the glove box.”

“Sounds easy enough,” Noah said. “Is everything so laid back and easygoing around here?”

“It really is. Out here at the edge of everything, it’s like a whole new world.”

“Well, thanks for everything,” Chris said, offering his hand to Jay.

“Oh, I was glad to fly you guys out here!” Jay took turns shaking everyone’s hands in the small space between ol’ Sally and the so-called control tower. “Now, there is one more thing I need to say,” Jay added, injecting a serious tone to his voice. “I know I made a joke about getting lost out in those woods, but really—if you don’t know what you’re doing out there, it is a real danger. So just be careful when you’re out there. The woods here…they can be a little disorienting.”

“Thanks for the heads up,” Bear said, shouldering his pack and looking towards the control tower.

Jay waved them off as the four friends crossed the rough patch of grass to the little building. Aside from the rather old SUV parked behind it, there were only two other cars—employees for the piss-poor little airstrip, Chris assumed.

They got to the SUV and found the doors unlocked. There was even a little Thank-You card tucked between the bottom of the windshield and the dashboard, signed by Carter Benton.

“My God, Bear,” Bobby said, as they tossed their bags into the SUV’s back hatch. “Do you think you could have sprung for a newer model?”

“I figured an older model means it’s been well used and has been modified for the rough roads,” Bear replied. “But if you want to give me some money for an upgrade, I’ll take it.”

“Nah, man. I’m just along for the ride.”

As they loaded into the SUV, they also found a topographical map of the area folded up in the passenger’s seat. Someone—presumably Mr. Carter Benson—had highlighted the route they needed to take. It took them from the airfield, into Birch, and then from Birch into a shaded area that represented the forest. A yellow circle had been drawn around the location of their cabin.

Chris peeked under the back seat and nodded. “Got a rifle and a box of shells tucked away back here. Looks like the gun is probably worth more than the car.”

“So, is it okay if I call…shotgun? Noah asked.

“That’s some weak humor,” Bobby said.

“Fine. To hell with shotgun. I’m driving.”

“You ever done any off-roading?” Bear asked.

“No. Never. That’s why I’m driving. It’s a bucket list thing.”

“Hey, I’m fine with it,” Bobby said. “If we didn’t die in ol’ Sally, I don’t see how Noah’s inexperienced back roads driving would kill us. I’m starting to feel damn near invincible.”

Chris laughed, but thought he understood. Now that they were here with feet on the ground and forests to all sides, he also felt a surge of freedom—not quite a feeling of invincibility, but of courage and excitement.

They climbed into the SUV, Noah at the wheel and Bobby at shotgun, while Bear and Chris took the back seat. Bear kept the map, serving as navigator. Yet, as it turned out, there wasn’t much need for navigation. After leaving the airfield down a thin dirt road, they took a right on a basic two-lane. It seemed to dart in a straight line through the woods, taking them further northwest. According to the map, this straight shot would take them into Birch after a twenty-two-mile drive.

“I’ve gotta say, I’m a bit disappointed,” Noah said. “This isn’t off-roading.”

“Not yet, anyway,” Bear said. “But from what I saw online, once we leave Birch and head for the cabin, it’ll be dirt tracks the whole way.”

“Awesome.”

“Okay, so wait,” Bobby said from the back, looking at his Apple watch. “Are you telling me Alaska has its own time zone?”

“Two, actually” Bear said. “One is just for Alaska, but certain parts of the state share a time zone with Hawaii.”

“That seems a bit ironic,” Chris stated.

“Half an hour before five o’clock,” Bobby said pushing out a heavy sigh. “Is there a convenience store in Birch? It’s about time to start drinking.”

“Didn’t you already start at the airport?” Noah asked.

“And then the plane,” Chris added.

“Don’t judge me,” Bobby said. “Only the Good Lord above can judge me.”

Chris found himself a little less hung up on Bobby’s insistence on turning everything towards drinking. Hell, they were on vacation. If there was ever any time to give in to such a vice, maybe it was now—away from the responsibilities of life. Not that Bobby had all that many.

Chris knew that there was a convenience store in Birch. They all did, actually, as they had worked it into their plans. They’d stop in Birch to get provisions—enough to last four days, so they only had to go back into the town a single time during their stay. From the reviews and pictures, they’d seen online, it wasn’t much of a convenience store at all, but it seemed to be all the little town of Birch, Alaska, had to offer.

It was a reminder of just how far off the beaten path they would be. And honestly, Chris was finding that more and more appealing. Hell, if he didn’t have Brianna waiting for him back home, he’d probably fantasize about staying somewhere like Birch, where no one would ever find him—a place he could forget about how his wife sometimes insisted on showering the instant she came home late from work or their consistently declining intimacy.

Yeah, the trees on both sides of the road almost seemed to offer a solution to that. Like Jay suggested, it wouldn’t take much to get lost out there. And as far as Chris was concerned, that might not be so bad.

---

Almost immediately after they passed a sign telling them that Birch was only three miles ahead, Chris started to see little patches of snow on the ground. It was nothing more than faint glimmers of frost along the side of the road at first, but then the patches became wider, whiter, and more pronounced. He also noted that even though they drew closer and closer to the town, the view never changed: trees, a few open spaces, snow, a slate grey sky.

“Not even trying to be funny,” Noah said, “but have any of you ever been to a place this lonely and remote?”

“Do Raiders games count?” Bobby asked.

“I did, as a kid,” Bear replied, ignoring Bobby’s remark. “My grandparents on my dad’s side lived in Kentucky. We’d go out there to see them up until Grandpa died. They lived in a small rural town. Not quite this rural, but pretty tiny. We did some camping, but nothing that would be considered roughing it.”

Slowly, the town of Birch presented itself to them. The thickly woven trees started to gradually disperse, giving way to cut-off roads and small lots with even smaller businesses. There was a barber shop and a post office in one lot, the parking area made partly of concrete and partly of cracked mud. Another lot boasted a small hardware store, a tiny gas station, and a bigger building that was shut down and boarded over.

Birch appeared to consist of just one little main street, with a few thinner, unmarked paved avenues winding away from town and back into the trees. There was plenty of open space for more businesses, but it seemed the residents had taken the clue; it was a town that wasn’t going to be re-built and the residents had accepted that long ago.

The convenience store Bear included in their plans sat at the very edge of town. It seemed to be positioned as a warning of sorts. This is your last chance to stop or turn back for a while, the little store implied. It was a tiny little square of a building. Chris supposed it had once been white but had been tinged by the elements for far too many years. There were ancient advertisements for cigarettes, beer, and soft drinks in the windows, hidden behind years of grime and neglect.

“You think they’ll have fresh deli meat?” Bobby asked with that all-too familiar sarcastic tone. “Maybe some organic veggies?”

“I don’t think I’d eat much of anything from this place,” Noah said skeptically.

“That’s a damn shame,” Bear said, adjusting his posture. “Because this is it. This is the only place for provisions. After this, it’s thirty miles of woodland and nothing more.”

“In other words, be prepared to have the squirts for the duration of the trip,” Bobby said.

Bear pulled into the lot and parked. The four friends stepped out into the cold. It was colder here than at the airfield, which seemed crazy to Chris. There had only been about twenty-nine miles between the two, but the cold air in Birch felt like it sliced right through his skin and caressed his bones. He tightened his coat up around his shoulders as they walked into the little store.

It was a cramped space, the epitome of tiny country stores everywhere. There were wood floors, a vinyl-topped counter that looked as if it had not been wiped down in years, and only four small aisles of food and other goods. In the back, to the far right, there were a few drink coolers and an ancient-looking box cooler. Behind the counter, there were racks of tobacco products and about a dozen rows of scratch lottery tickets.

The proprietor, an older lady with long grey hair gave them a wide smile, though it was clear she was taken aback. Based on her skin tone, Chris thought she might be one of the local natives Jay had mentioned on the way up—maybe Yupik or Inuit. It made Chris feel slightly ignorant. He wished he’d done a little more research before coming on the trip. Maybe he would have if he had not been so worried about his marriage.

“How are you, ma’am?” Bear asked, ever the crowd-pleaser.

“Good,” the woman said. “Vacation?”

“Something like that.”

“Fishing, I guess?” the woman asked.

“We’re going to try,” Noah said.

“This is a good time of year for it,” the woman said.

The more she spoke, the more certain Chris became that she wasn’t comfortable with the four of them being in her store. She was not being rude by any means, but was looking back and forth between them as if waiting for one of them to pull a gun.

They forked out and worked together to get supplies. It almost made Chris feel like he was back in college, a freshman with no money and lacking any real idea of how to properly survive on his own. While there was no fresh deli meat of any kind as Bobby had suggested, there were plastic packs of pre-cut bologna, turkey, and ham. There were also plenty of canned goods: soups, fruit, vegetables, gross little sausages, Spam, and a few other items Chris couldn’t begin to imagine putting into his body.

He grabbed a couple of boxes of crackers, a box of Frosted Flakes, a package of cold hot dogs, and a few packs of tiny donuts. He pictured what Vicki would say about this choice of food, though there really wasn’t much to choose from. Noah, Bobby, and Bear were picking out their items with the same level of scrutiny. He saw Noah closely reading the back label on some sort of packaged meat in a can before returning it to the shelf.

While Chris went to the drink coolers to grab bottled waters and a few sodas, he saw that Bobby had already found the beer. It was located in the very old box cooler. With the lid opened, Chris could hear the motor running, a little puff of cold air came out of the cooler and into the store. Bobby rummaged around inside for a while and worked at getting out a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon, followed by a second.

“The selection is a little grim,” Bobby said, lugging the two cases to the front of the store. “But this will do. This is all me, by the way. You clowns can get your own.”

“Are you serious?” Chris said. It was out before he could stop it, and it came out sounding irritated rather than good-natured. “It’s only four days, man.”

“Yeah? And? It’s also vacation. And I like to drink my ass off when I’m on vacation.”

“Just vacation?” Chris said. Apparently, his mouth was just going to run off on its own today.

“Ah, Jesus, are you really going to pull this?” Bobby said, rolling his eyes. “Sorry, Dad…so I need your permission to buy beer?”

“No, it’s just—” Chris’s words fell flat as Bobby turned away.

But Bobby wasn’t even pretending to listen to Chris’s response. With a scowl on his face, he walked towards the front of the store, set the beer down in the center of one of the aisles, and also grabbed some chips. He then went directly to the counter with the food and beer without speaking to anyone else. He paid for his stuff and then stormed out.

Noah and Bear came to the drink coolers, looking out towards the front door. “What did you say to piss him off?” Noah asked.

“I may have commented on all the beer.”

“Good,” Noah said. He then reached into his coat pocket and jingled the keys. “His temper tantrum is going to get him cold, though. The doors on the SUV are locked, and I have the keys.”

It took another three minutes of deliberation to finish their shopping trip. They split the cost of the groceries and the lady behind the counter seemed quite pleased at the amount she’d sold. Watching as she filled the bags, Chris thought it might not be as bare-bones as he was thinking. They’d gotten several loaves of bread, some peanut butter, a few packs of bologna, a dozen or so packs of Ramen noodles, crackers, waters, milk, some individual beer—just six packs for them, though—and assorted snacks.

When they walked back outside, they all grinned in unison at the sight of Bobby standing against the SUV. His cartons of beer and bags sat on the ground, as his hands were stuffed into his pockets.

“Oh, ha ha,” Bobby said as they came down the store steps and to the parking lot. “Very funny. Can you unlock the doors now?”

Noah hurried over to do exactly that. He popped open the back hatch first, where they all worked to stuff the groceries in among their bags. It was a tight fit and made a lopsided mountain of sorts, but it worked. Bear slammed the hatch shut and when they all turned to get into the car, there was a man standing by the hood.

He said nothing at first, just glared at them as if they were a swarm of pesky insects. The man looked old, but carried his age well. Chris guessed him to be about seventy or so, his chin and nose both pointed and almost triangular. He had long white hair and wore a hat that was an odd mix of fedora and cowboy hat. He looked for more Caucasian than the woman in the store, but still had something of a darker tone to his skin.

“Where are you headed?” the man asked once he could see he had everyone’s attention. His voice was eerily soft.

“Ice fishing out on Maupin Lake,” Chris said.

“Which side?”

“On the western rim,” Bear answered.

The man nodded and then placed his hand on the hood of the SUV. “Safe travels, friends. Take care of one another out there. If I were you, I’d never go out alone. Always in a pair, at least.”

“Yeah, our pilot told us how people get lost out there,” Chris said.

The man nodded again and then looked at each of them individually, for about two seconds each. “Lost,” he said, with a thin smile. “Sometimes worse. The forest…it often takes whatever it wants.”

Chris was just waiting for Bobby to say something sarcastic about the ghost stories Jay had told them about. But he was apparently still fuming over their brush-up in the store, because he kept quiet.

The old man gave them a solemn nod before turning away and heading slowly for the store. As the four friends climbed into the SUV, Noah chuckled nervously. “As far as welcome wagons go, that one sort of sucked.”

Noah cranked the engine to life and pulled back out into the road. Chris took a moment to look into the rearview, watching the little store shrink into the distance. As the trees and thin accumulation of snow on the ground started to fall in on all sides, it was like watching the world disappear.`,

      content: `The paved road continued for another four miles once they passed by the little sign that read Birch Town Limits. There was no abrupt stop to the pavement, more like a rough transition. There were potholes and worn grooves that eventually tapered off to nothing, giving way to a well-packed dirt track. The dirt road clearly got used quite a lot; there were no ditches to the sides, but rather slight rises in the ground to keep wandering vehicles on the road. It was almost like driving in a very shallow ravine.

“Okay, so here comes the off-roading part, I guess,” Bear said. “Think you can handle it, Noah?”

Noah looked like a little kid that had just strapped himself into a bumper car. “Hell yeah.”

In the back, Bobby made a very theatrical display of clicking his seatbelt into place. It was the first Bobby-like thing he’d done since leaving the store.

But Noah didn’t get much off-roading experience at first. The road stayed straight most of the way, growing slightly narrower the further into the forest they went. There were a few bumps and dips, but they were mostly along the farther edges of the trail. The little rises on the sides of the road flattered out a bit but the risk of slipping off of the road was still very small. However, as the road took a slightly downhill turn, Chris did notice that the patches of snow and ice in the forest and along the edge of the road were becoming more abundant.

About twelve minutes into the drive, Bear sat up and pointed to a curve in the road up ahead. “When you get to that little bend up there, we stay straight. According to the map and the site I saw, that bend takes you down into some sort of quarry and then back around into Birch.”

Noah came to the bend, ignored it, and kept going straight…and it took hardly any time at all for them all to realize that this was where the real adventure would begin.

The well-packed road was gone now, instantly giving way to what looked to be little more than a trail. The sides were still well-defined but it was much rougher; woodland debris and patches of snow and ice covered the dirt track.

Bear directed Noah into several other turns. With each turn, the road got a bit rougher. For a stretch of about half a mile, it appeared that Noah was driving on nothing more than the forest floor. But then the trail came back into view, bending slightly to the west. What served as the road was routinely interrupted by outcroppings of rock, low-hanging branches, and tree roots that poked up out of the ground.

The shocks squealed, and the four men chuckled nervously. After another bare patch of ground, Chris was about to ask if they were lost. And if they were, God help them because turning around and heading back up the road was going to be absolute hell. But just before true worry started to settle in, the trail reappeared and then smoothed out considerably. It was still bumpy, but it at least resembled a road that had been created on purpose.

“According to directions from the website,” Bear said, “there should be a slight drop to the land and then our cabin is just around the corner.”

As if summoned by Bear’s voice, the land did indeed start to drop off a bit. The hill turned slightly to the right and, as it did; it presented an entirely new section of the forest to them. The trees seemed to grow thicker and the snow along the ground was more solid. It was not deep by any means, but the bare spots along the ground were far less common that the ground just half-a-mile back.

After a quarter of a mile or so of a very gradual decline to the ground, things flattened back out. Chris felt that the SUV was practically being hugged by the forest as the trees seemed to be almost woven together. But just as soon as a sense of claustrophobia overtook him, an opening appeared up ahead—gradual at first but then a vista of open space. Sitting in the center of it was a quaint log cabin. It was small and rustic, exactly what had they been promised. The lawn around it was mostly dead from the cold, and the surrounding trees no longer looked threatening, but almost enticing.

From the outside, the cabin appeared incredibly small, and Chris had no idea how they were all going to live together in it for a week. It had two simple windows along the front and a meager but functional little porch running along its length. A smaller back porch jutted out from the back and a very basic roof of logs and shingles ran down along the top at a severe angle.

“Home sweet home,” Bear said, clapping his massive hands together.

“How far away is the lake?” Noah asked.

“About a mile straight behind the house. There’s supposed to be a walking trail back there somewhere.”

There was no driveway of any kind, just an abrupt stop to the road. Noah pulled into the yard a bit, swinging the SUV around so that the tailgate faced the front door to make unpacking a little easier. He shut off the engine and they all got out, shutting their doors and heading for the back. As Bobby reached for the handle to pop down the tailgate, Bear stopped him and pointed up, making a little circle with his finger.

“Hear that?” he asked.

The other three listened intently, but Chris knew right away what Bear was going for. He was clearly the most excited among them, eager to experience it all.

“What am I supposed to be hearing?” Bobby asked.

“Nothing. Nothing at all. Isn’t it amazing?”

Bobby rolled his eyes and opened up the back of the SUV. “Are you going to go all Walden on us and start writing poetry and shit while we’re out here?”

“You know, I just might,” Bear said. “And screw Walden. Walden sucks. Robert Frost is where it’s at.”

Bobby shrugged as he slid his two cases of beer out of the back. “Dude, I can’t even pretend to listen. I’m not talking poets and writers and whimsical feelings while we’re out here.”

They worked together to unload the rest of their things. When it was all out and sitting in the yard, Bear took out the key to the cabin and stepped up onto the small, slightly lopsided porch. He unlocked the door, opened it, and stepped inside.

Noah stepped in behind him and it took about two seconds for the screaming to start.`,

      content: `While Noah and Bear let out screams at roughly the same time, Chris and Bobby, still out on the porch, broke out into gales of laughter. Bobby laughed so hard that he dropped one of his cases of beer. Chris nearly fell back down the three porch steps and to the ground because of the sudden attack of laughter.

When Bear opened the door, an enormous rat came rushing out. It was about the size of a modest cat; its tail was thick and serpentine. It actually scampered between Chris’s feet as it made its escape, frightened by the sudden appearance of humans. As Chris continued to laugh, he saw that Bear was coming around to what had happened. He looked embarrassed, but he was also laughing now. Noah, on the other hand, looked a little angry as he stormed inside.

“Maybe that was just the maid,” Bobby said, picking up his fallen case of beer and walking inside.

“Well, it sure was big enough to hold a broom,” Chris said. He felt relieved to have a little laugh with Bobby after their brief confrontation at the store. It did feel a little forced, but laughter was laughter and he’d take it over tense silence any day.

“This place is already getting a negative online review from me,” Noah said as they all entered the cabin.

Chris idly looked around on the floor to see if there were more rats or, at the very least, droppings from the large specimen they’d just seen. He saw nothing of the sort tough and actually found the cabin to be much nicer than the exterior had suggested. The central area was largely open; the small living room and kitchen were connected with nothing to separate them. The only indication that they were two different rooms was the spot along the floor where the wood floor of the living room became the tiled floor of the kitchen. The living room contained a couch, an old tattered recliner, and a small half-bookshelf lined with a few paperbacks. There was no dining room, just a square wooden table pushed to the far side of the kitchen, right beside the refrigerator. Along the right and left sides of the living room, there were three doors, opened to reveal bedrooms. A bathroom sat just off of the kitchen, though Chris knew from the website description that the larger bedroom also contained a bathroom.

“Well, it’s no worse than my college dorm,” Chris said.

“You got that right,” Noah said.

“Bobby, all that drinking…it doesn’t give you gas, does it?” Bear asked.

“Not usually.” Bobby put the cases on the table in the kitchen and tore into one. “But this is Pabst…some cheap stuff. So…yeah, I’m probably going to be stinking the place up. By the way, I call the larger bedroom.”

“Sorry, already claimed,” Bear said. “I paid ten percent more than everyone else and did all the research. Chris arranged everything and did the booking. So, if anyone gets it, it’s one of us.”

“It’s all yours,” Chris said. “I don’t want to bear the responsibility of having the second bathroom all to myself.”

Bear seemed perfectly fine with this, taking his bags into the single bedroom on the left side of the living quarters. Bobby shrugged and sat down on the couch with a can of beer. “Fine with me,” he said. “I’ll just pass out on the couch every night.”

“Whatever makes you happy,” Noah said, walking into one of the two rooms on the right with his luggage.

Chris started for the third bedroom but paused before entering. He looked back to Bobby, doing his best to put his judgmental side to rest. Though Bobby could be a cantankerous ass, they were friends. And setting up camp in any drama was only going to make this trip unnecessarily miserable.

“A week on the couch is going to be awful. Why don’t you and I rotate out in this room? I’ll take it one night, you take it the next.”

“Nah, it’s all yours,” Bobby said. He gave Chris an uncertain glance that made him wonder if Bobby was also trying to push aside their awkward encounter back at the store. For all Chris knew, Bobby had already moved on.

“You sure?” Chris said.

“Yeah, I’m not trying to rock the boat. Bear made a point to let us know that you and him are the head honchos of this trip.”

There might have been some venom in the remark, but both men let it go. Chris walked into the bedroom, scanning it for rats. The bed was a twin, the sheets crisp and freshly washed. As he set his bags down on the bed, he tried to imagine the poor cleaning and maintenance crews who had to come down that bumpy road to fix the place up before and after guests stayed in the cabin.

The bedroom also offered a small chest of drawers and a very small closet. A ramshackle little table sat by the right side of the bed. That was about it. Chris took his phone out of his pocket and checked to see if there was any signal out here. He was not at all surprised to find a single X where the service indicators usually were. He had told Vicki several days ago that once they got to the cabin, he doubted there would be any service or anyway to get in touch with her. They could have paid extra to get a MiFi connected out to the cabin, but opted not to in order to get the more “off the grid” experience. He found himself already regretting that decision. While he doubted Vicki wouldn’t care if she had to go a week or so without talking to him, knowing there was no way to reach out to her was somehow depressing. It occurred to him all over again that it also meant a week without speaking to Brianna, a realization that stung his heart.

He plugged his phone charger into the room’s only electrical outlet and his phone to the charger. He then opened up the drawers on the bureau, but found them dusty and smelling of stale cleaner, so he opted to leave his fresh clothes in his bags. As he was going through his toiletry bag, anxious to grab a shower as soon as he could, there was a knock at his door. It did not surprise him to find Bear staring in. He looked antsy, ready to get out and explore.

“Settled in already?” Chris asked.

“It wasn’t hard. Just a few clothes. I was going to head out back to see if that’s where they’re keeping the fishing gear. The website listing said there should be some sort of shed, right?”

“Yeah, I think so. Let’s go see.”

By the time they left Chris’s room and started for the small door on the backside of the kitchen, Noah and Bobby had fallen behind them as well. With a stirring of excitement in the air, all four of them had grabbed their first beer of the trip (all except Bobby, of course, as he was already on his way to being buzzed) and headed outside.

Standing on the back porch, Chris saw that there was a fire pit not too far away from the steps. Several rugged and wooden chairs circled it, the sort of chairs made by hand and not in some factory. On the back porch itself stood an old charcoal grill and a few of the same chairs that were positioned down in the yard.

The shed they’d come out to see was really nothing more than a large storage closet of sorts that had been built into the side of the porch—the sort of thing some people parked lawnmowers in back home. The twin doors were padlocked together but Bear had collected a key for that as well. He popped the lock and swung the doors open. The interior of the shed was surprisingly clean, with a wooden floor and a variety of hooks on the wall.

The shed itself was no larger than a small closet, stocked with eight different fishing rods and two tackle boxes. There was also a strange device propped up in the corner. It looked like a very large corkscrew, the height and width of a shovel. Chris was pretty sure this was what was used to drill a hole in the ice out on the lake. He’d done some very limited reading on the topic and was pretty sure it was called an auger. He supposed the electric drill propped by the wall was used to bore it into the ice.

“Well, this is certainly fascinating,” Bobby said from behind them. It was clear that he was being sarcastic, taking a long hard pull from his beer after saying it.

Bear ignored him and looked over at the tackle boxes. Chris watched over his shoulder as he checked the contents. There was plenty of fishing line, weights, hooks and scaling knives. There were three tackle boxes, all fully equipped. It seemed that the minimal nature of the cabin was being made up in the overwhelming contents of the fishing supplies.

Content with their equipment, Bear closed the doors and re-clasped the lock. As he did, Chris took a look around the brief stretch of backyard beyond the firepit and the chairs. The trees towered over them, swaying slightly in a barely there frigid breeze. The chill in the air was getting more bitter as night approached, but there was something almost comforting about it. Chris had often wondered if there was some deep-buried need in every man to be alone, isolated in nature, leaving the trappings of the real world behind. He thought he could feel that sort of primitive leaning stirring within him as he took it all in. And as he walked back into the cabin, at least eighteen miles away from the next living person, he warmly welcomed that part of him. Over the course of the next few days, he hoped to get better acquainted with it.

---

Night came slowly at first, but once the first tinges of darkness had crept in, it fall quite fast. It was almost as if the stripped and towering trees had summoned it and then, when it had gotten close enough, pulled the night down on top of their frigid corner of the world. The cabin had central heat, though they opted to use the small fireplace, using firewood they’d found stacked on the other side of the shed.

It was so cold outside that it almost seemed foolish to wander out purposefully into the backyard after nightfall. But that’s exactly what they did, firing up the grill and huddling around the firepit. Chris felt almost like a child again, warming his hands around the pit while Noah manned the grill—not the toughest of jobs, as all they were having were hot dogs and bologna.

“So, Bobby,” Noah said as he brought the hotdogs over on a paper plate. “I guess this is probably the best dinner you’ve had in quite some time, huh?”

“Not at all. The best dinner I had was at Logan’s Road House a few nights ago. Best steak I ever had.” He looked around at the three of them and gave a chuckle. “Oh, I’m sorry. Was that supposed to be the group’s way of ribbing me for not being married and having nice sit-down family meals every night?”

Bear laughed as he sipped from his can of beer. “Take from it what you want.”

“Hey, I’m fine with you guys laying into me about still being single. I know it’s just envy. I mean, maybe there’s some hidden joy in being tied down to the same sexual partner for the rest of your life, sex with the same person every single night, but—”

“Every night?” Noah said. “Hardly.”

“You’re only furthering my point,” Bobby said. He snatched a hot dog off of the paper plate, which Noah had balanced on the edge of the fire pit. “The way I see it, you guys should be asking me how I do it.”

“Still humble, I see,” Chris said.

The sad thing was, that primal part of him that enjoyed being out in the middle of nowhere was envious of Bobby. The guy was creeping up on forty years of age and had the sex life of an amorous twenty-one-year-old. He’d brought his much younger flavor-of-the-month girlfriends to poker games and cookouts in the past just to flaunt them. And while he often bragged of his exploits, there was the one in particular he tended not to brag about, but they all knew about it, anyway.

The year before, when Bobby had been thirty-six, he’d been working as a graphic designer for a small marketing firm. He’d had the job for about three years, which was something of a record for him. When the firm hired a female eighteen-year-old intern who had just started college, Bobby had made jokes about what he wanted to do to her. As it turned out, it took less than two months; Chris and the others weren’t quite sure how long it had been going on, but Bobby and the intern had been sleeping together. Not only that, but they’d been hooking up at work. Bobby was fired when the boss walked in on them in the bathroom during business hours, Bobby having forgotten to lock the door.

What struck Chris as odd was that it seemed like the sort of escapade a guy like Bobby would boast about every chance he got. But he’d kept it quiet, and Chris had always wondered what a strange sort of shame Bobby felt over it.

The four of them fell into silence, the only noise coming from the crackle of the fire and the barely audible sighing of the wind. Chris caught sight of Bobby popping the tab on another beer. He hated that it made him angry; he was not Bobby’s father. Honestly, he was more afraid of how Bobby being hammered the entire trip might affect them.

He said nothing about it, though, choosing to look back to the shed. “So, Bear…do you think you can teach us all how to ice fish without at least one of us falling in the lake and freezing to death?”

“I think so. But I make no promises. Noah, you said you’d done it once before, right?”

“Once…many, many years ago. And I don’t remember enjoying it.”

“Other than the cold,” Chris said, “is it really all that much harder than normal fishing?”

“Not based on what I’ve read,” Bear said.

“Yeah,” Noah added. “From what I can remember, it’s really all about y—”

A howling noise in the distance interrupted Bear. It was unmistakably a wolf, and it didn’t even sound particularly menacing. The fear Chris felt came in simply knowing that they were all alone, with wolves parading around somewhere close by.

Noah gave them all a nervous smile that Chris understood perfectly. It was like camping as a child, fully aware of the wonders and the dangers of nature. Toss in an almost bone-chilling cold and a very dark night, and it made it that much more exciting.

Slightly to the east, the original howl was met with another one. This corresponding wolf replied with two shorter howls. It sounded a little louder than the other wolf, more dominant.

“There’s ammo with that rifle in the car, right?” Bobby said. His head looked to be swiveling all around, as if he expected the wolves to come out of the woods at any moment.

“Yeah,” Bear said. “It’s a Remington rifle and there’s a whole box of ammo.”

“I know nothing about guns,” Bobby said. “Will a Remington blow a wolf’s head off?”

“Hardly. But it’ll hurt it enough to make it not want to come back.”

“Good enough, I guess.”

“Yeah,” Noah replied, getting up from his chair and taking a hotdog with him. “Those wolves are like Mama calling. Time to get inside.”

Chris followed behind him, with Bobby and Bear coming in behind. It was clear to Chris that everyone was fine with heading inside, but no one really wanted to admit it. As Chris walked in behind Noah, he heard another howl in the distance, followed by another noise…not a howl, but something else.

Something moving. Whatever it was, it was either very close, very big—or both. The rustling of leaves, and something very much like footsteps, sounded to be just at the edge of their rented back yard. As Chris turned his attention that way, he also heard the sound of branches or twigs snapping

“What the hell was that?” Bobby asked. He and Bear were still standing on the porch. Noah and Chris had barely stepped inside the doorway, still peering out into the night.

“A bear, maybe?” Noah said.

“Bears don’t live out…” Bobby started to say and then looked accusingly to Bear. “Wait, do they? Are there bears out here?”

“Yeah. Mostly grizzlies from what I gather. It is Alaska, dumbass.”

“Great,” Bobby said, pushing his way by Bear and then past Chris and Noah. “That, my delicious-tasting friends, is the last time I’m venturing outside at night while we’re here. Now get your butts inside and let me school you all at poker.”

Chuckling nervously, they all went inside. Chris closed the door behind them, taking one last look out into the night-shrouded trees and trying not to notice that the darkness now seemed even thicker after having heard those noises.`,

      content: `All things considered, the first night went much better than Chris expected. Bobby had gotten drunk, but not too far gone. He’d actually been in a good mood when they’d called it a night. All four of them had been laughing and joking over countless hands of poker, and Chris had no qualms admitting it that it was the most fun he’d had in a very long time. For that one chunk of time, between the howling wolves and ending the poker game (where Cheerios and crackers were used as bets), Chris had not thought of Vicki’s potential affair at all.

But as he lay in bed, it was all he thought about. He wondered if she was with her lover in that very moment. He wondered if she was in their bed with him and if so, if Vicki had at least waited for Brianna to go to sleep.

It was all ridiculous, really. While he was all but certain his wife was cheating on him, he also knew that Vicki loved Brianna more than anything. If she brought her lover over for some fun, it would be when Brianna wasn’t there—like on Saturday night, during Brianna’s sleepover with a friend. Vicki might be a cheat, but she was at least sensible and kind when it came to their daughter.

He wasn’t sure how long he’d been pondering these things. What he did know was that lying in bed at night while tortured by what-ifs and worst-case scenarios had a way of devouring time. He rolled over in the surprisingly comfortable bed and checked his phone. It did not surprise him to see that it had somehow come to be 1:20 in the morning—about an hour and a half after they’d called it a night.

He set the phone down and closed his eyes again. Almost right away, he heard a distant noise from outside. More howling. He thought it might be the wind, but the wind didn’t seem to be blowing at all. Other than the distant howls, the faint crackling of the fire from the fireplace in the living room, and Bobby’s snoring, the entire setting was quiet. For a while, he thought he felt that pleasant pull behind his eyes as he started to fall into sleep, but then his bladder reminded him that he’d had four beers and a glass of water before bed.

Chris got out of bed with an irritated sigh. He was dressed in jogging shorts as he left his room and ventured out to the main bathroom. He was so focused on getting to the bathroom by the faint light coming from the fireplace that he almost didn’t see the shape sitting at the table in the kitchen.

His heart hammered, and he took a tentative step back before he realized that it was just Bear. He was scrolling through something on his phone, looking up rather guiltily, when he heard the slight noise of Chris’s startled surprise.

“Sorry about that,” Bear whispered.

“No worries,” Chris said, a bit embarrassed. “If the bears don’t kill me, maybe a heart attack will. What are you doing out here?”

Bear shrugged, a gesture that looked far too lazy and childlike for a man of his size. “Couldn’t sleep. I usually have a hard time sleeping in a new place.”

Chris looked back over toward the sofa to where Bobby was still snoring. “Maybe he’s on to something. Maybe we just needed to get hammered.”

“I’ll keep that in mind for tomorrow night. What about you? Can’t sleep, either?”

“Pretty much. Too much going on in my head. I can’t turn my brain off.”

“I have a feeling none of us will have the problem tomorrow. Walking out in that cold takes it out of you.” Bear hesitated a moment and then looked across the table at Chris. With the only light coming from Bear’s cellphone and the fireplace in the living room, he looked like a ghost. “Can I ask you something?”

“Sure.”

“Do you feel something weird about this place?”

“You mean aside from it being located right on the edge of the world?”

Bear grinned and nodded. “Yeah, besides that.”

“I don’t think so. I mean, yeah, I feel isolated. But that’s sort of the point of being all the way out here, right?”

“Yeah, that’s right. It’s just…I don’t know. Things feel tense…weird.”

“I guess so. But no more tense that riding in that damn plane to get out here. Stepping onto that rust bucket might have been one of the most terrifying moments of my life.”

“Don’t talk about Ol’ Sally like that. Also, keep in mind that you have to get back on that plane to make it back home.”

“Wonderful.” He let the good-natured comments settle a bit before he added: “Seriously, Barret. Are you okay?”

Bear cringed at the sound of his actual name. His friends reserved the use of it for more serious matters. “I’m fine. Maybe I wasn’t as prepared for the isolation as I thought. And if I’m being honest,” he said, stopping to look over at Bobby for a moment, “this petty squabble between the two of you has got me on edge. I know he’s a lot to handle, but this whole thing could do him some good, too.”

“I know. I’m going to try to just ignore it. I wish I could tell you why it bothers me so much, but…”

“Is it jealousy?”

The question sounded odd at first, but then stung a bit. Chris took a moment to process what it might mean before answering. “I don’t think so. I apparently can’t keep one woman happy, much less several.”

“You and Vicki okay?” He immediately frowned and gave a hands-up gesture, sensing he’d gone too far. “Never mind. I retract that question. None of my business.”

“We’re fine,” Chris said, though in his mind’s eye he found it very easy to imagine her in bed with another man, perched on top of him and enjoying it in a way she never had with him. He shook it out of his mind and slowly got back to his feet.

“You good? I didn’t mean to pry.”

“No, I’m good. You weren’t prying. I just need to get to sleep or he’s going to be a lot to deal with tomorrow.” He hitched his thumb back toward Bobby as he said this.

“I hear that,” Bear said.

He pocketed his cell phone and headed off for his own room. Chris watched him go and then looked back over to Bobby’s sleeping, snoring shape. Maybe he was being too hard on him. Chris was confident that there was no jealousy there; maybe it was concern, instead. Maybe he had reached that age where he felt it was his responsibility to make sure his friends were taking care of themselves. And while he felt that was noble, he also did not think it was his place to frown upon Bobby if he wanted to spend his four-day trip out into the Alaskan wilderness in a drunken haze.

Of course, this was a bit harder to focus on when Chris could still hear those buzzsaw snores from his room, even with the door closed. He focused on the snores and the irritation they produced and it managed to keep thoughts of Vicki away. Before he knew it, he was falling asleep and when it came, it was heavy and deep.`,

      content: `Once asleep, thoughts of Vicki and her adulterous relationship seemed to have been scrubbed from his mind. Instead, he had the dream again—the one he’d had yesterday morning, before leaving for their trip. It was nearly identical, the only difference being that he seemed to be flying closer to the trees now. He could see the forest floor much clearer. Several deer took off galloping as he flew near them. To his right, a hawk swooped in to investigate and then, seeing him, sailed off as quickly as it could.

He flew forward and could feel the icy wind on his face. Actually, to say the wind was cold was not quite accurate. He had no idea if it was cool or warm; all he knew was that it stirred around him and he could feel the air currents as he either fell or flew.

Somewhere down below, he could hear screams. Something fierce and terrified. Not human screams, but perhaps those of a mauled animal or a—

“What the…?”

Chris jerked awake at the sound of a panicked voice shouting on the other side of his bedroom door—Noah’s voice. Chris sat up quickly and for a moment, his brain was trapped somewhere between the dream and the real world. It alarmed him at first, his heart hammering from Noah’s shouting, but he then heard light-hearted laughter behind it. It was Bear’s laughter, the sort of laugh that seemed to be tailor-made for a man that spent his Christmas season dressed as Santa. And while Bear had the heart for such a thing, Chris was pretty sure the man had never donned a Santa suit.

He sat up and grabbed his phone from the bedside table. The clock read 7:17. The battery indicator was full, but the service indicator was just as dead as ever. He put the phone back down, slid out of bed, and dug his bathroom kit out of his bag. When he walked out into the living room, he found Noah stoking the fire and grinning about something, shaking his head.

“What the hell were you screaming about?” Chris asked.

“Bear’s morning farts, man. They’re awful.”

Bear continued to laugh from in the kitchen. He was cooking up some sort of lazy man’s breakfast. Chris tried to imagine what they had in the way of breakfast foods but as far as he knew, all they had was cereal and granola bars.

“It’s an every-morning thing, boys,” Bear said. “Been that way most of my life. I won’t apologize for my nature.”

“Your wife,” Noah said rather theatrically. “That brave, poor woman.”

Chris caught a whiff of something rather nasty-smelling, too. He wrinkled his nose and looked around for a moment. “Where’s Bobby?”

“Bathroom,” Bear said. “He was up before anyone else, believe it or not.”

“Great. I’ve got to piss something awful.”

“Go outside,” Noah said, done poking at the fire. “It’s one of the splendors of life in the woods. And while you’re out there, grab a few logs, would you? The fire is down to pretty much nothing.”

The thought of stepping outside in his shorts and a tee shirt was painful. He could only imagine how cold it must be out there. But at the same time, there was a boyish sort of mischief that loved the idea. And before he was fully aware of what he was doing, Chris set his bathroom travel bag on the edge of the couch and headed for the front door.

“Remember when you head out,” Noah said, “that the cold is going to make things shrink up. No need to start feeling bad for yourself.”

Chris scoffed at this, not sure how he felt about the cabin sounding like a middle school locker room. He opened the door, stepped outside, and instantly stopped in his tracks.

He stumbled backwards, a shout of surprise crawling up his throat but getting stuck. His eyes and brain frantically tried to work together to make sense of what was waiting on the porch.

In the end, the only thing that came out was: “Jeee-sus.”

“Too cold for you?” Noah said.

“No…it’s…”

He stood in the doorway, looking out. What terrified him wasn’t what he saw (although it was extremely bad), but the fact that he almost stepped on it. He sensed Noah coming up behind him, uttering a curse as his eyes fell on what was waiting on the front step for them.

There was a deer on the front steps. It was a ten-point buck, laying on its side. Its entire stomach had been torn open, blood and entrails spilling out onto the steps and the ground below. There was nothing intricate or designed about the kill; this had not been the work of a hunter that knew how to cut and gut a deer. No, this had been a brutal attack. It looked as if some blunt instrument had been shoved into the deer’s guts and then simply pulled down with tremendous force. The hide was ragged and skewed. Shattered portions of rib shone through the red, grisly mess. Oddly enough, the carcass almost resembled a shredded paper bag. Its guts steamed a bit, still kinked together and almost neatly arranged.

It was the first time Chris had ever seen an animal’s insides. It was brighter and somehow cleaner than he’d expected. The intestines were tightly coiled, and what he thought might be the liver looked almost plush and soft. If not for the copious amounts of blood, it might have been fascinating enough to stand there and study for several moments.

Bear joined them at the door. “Good Lord,” he said. “I don’t remember ordering this.” He was trying to be funny, but Chris heard the worry in his voice. In a flash, he recalled the brief conversation they’d had at the kitchen table last night while the others had slept. Certainly, this little incident was not going to make Bear feel any better about being out here.

“Why’s it here at all?” Chris said. “I mean, if we were to come across it in the woods, I’d guess it got into a fight with a bear and lost. But here…on our steps?”

“Could still be a bear,” Noah said.

“A bear that was smart enough to drag it up onto our porch and leave it there for us?”

“I don’t know,” Noah said. “Our cat does that kind of thing with birds and rats all the time.”

“Because they think they’re giving you a gift,” Bear pointed out. “They’re showing you they’re protective of their home and want to prove it to you.”

“Really?” Noah said.

“Yeah. But I don’t think a bear would maul something like this and drag its corpse up just to—”

“Close the damn door!” Bobby yelled from behind them. “What are you idiots doing, anyway? How the…ah hell, what is that?”

Chris looked back and saw that Bobby had joined them in the doorway. “Breakfast,” Chris said, doing his best to be funny and ignore the little sliver of dread that had wormed its way into his heart. “Grab a spoon.”

“That’s sick. Seriously, what the hell is going on?”

“Don’t know,” Chris said. “I stepped out to take a leak and found this here.”

“Well, how did it get here?”

“We were just trying to figure that out before you interrupted,” Bear said. “We’ve ruled out bear. It just makes no sense.”

“What about a local?” Noah said. “I mean, I know there aren’t any locals per se because we’re in the middle of nowhere, but maybe someone from Birch is playing a trick on us?”

“I guess that could be a possibility,” Bear said.

Chris thought so, too. It seemed to be the only thing that fit. But then again, the way the buck’s stomach had been absolutely butchered looked a little too violent for any sane human to have pulled it off. If it had been some teenager from Birch playing a prank, they’d have to be pretty demented to gut the deer like this.

The cold of the morning caught up with Chris. A shiver ran through him—one that he tried to tell himself was only the result of the cold and not the grisly sight of the deer. “Well, if it was a prank, the pranksters have won because I’m standing here in my pajamas, freezing my balls off.”

As he walked back in, the others also turned away. Bobby closed the door behind them, a look of awe and confusion on his face. “Should we report it?”

“To who?” Bear said with a shaky laugh. “The Birch police? A game warden?”

“Are there even game wardens out here?” Noah asked.

“Hell if I know. My point is, no one is going to really care one way or another.”

“I say we move it and get on with our day,” Chris said. “At the end of the day, it’s a dead deer and we are out in the middle of the woods. Either a very smart bear or some low-life from Birch put it there. Maybe even someone else at another one of these cabin rentals out on the lake.”

“Good point,” Noah said. “It’s gross, but not anything to worry about.”

“Agreed,” Bear said. “And Chris, you said we just move it, right?”

“Yeah.”

“Then why don’t you get dressed and do just that? I almost lost my appetite, but not quite.”

And with that simple comment, the tension was mostly diffused. Yes, there was a badly mauled deer on their steps, but shutting the door on it had basically erased the matter. Out of sight, out of mind. It was like when Chris forced himself to shut a mental door on worries about his marriage or his concerns about Bobby’s drinking.

He picked up his bathroom kit from the edge of the couch and headed into the bathroom. As he closed the door behind him, imagery from his dream flipped through his head as if someone were thumbing through a magazine. For a moment, he saw that sprawling forest in front of him rather than the bathroom wall and small mirror over the sink. He saw a group of deer running, saw the curious hawk, and the trees passing by in a blur of green.

And then it was all gone. He braced himself against the toilet for a moment as his head felt heavy, dizzy. He steadied himself with a deep breath and got ready for the day, though the sight of the buck’s glistening insides was never far from his mind.`,

      content: `Just as Chris figured, Bear was there to help when it was time to move the deer carcass. While Noah and Bobby were in the cabin packing down the cooler for their day out on the lake, Chris and Bear moved the deer away from the steps. It was heavier than Chris had expected and the body had gone stiff—from the cold or rigor mortis; he wasn’t sure. He took the front and back legs on the right side of the body, and Bear took the left side.

When they moved the body, the insides came sliding along with it. More of its offal unspooled in a way that would have been almost comical if not for the noise it made. Chris had a strong stomach. but seeing something like this made him wonder how men could skin and dissect these animals after a kill. He understood the allure of hunting, and though he’d never been in any real capacity, he appreciated the nature of it. But when it came to slicing into an animal and stripping its insides for meat, he could not wrap his brain around it. The sight of the deer’s insides dragging behind it as he and Bear carried it to the edge of the woods didn’t help.

“Not here,” Bear said as they came to the tree line. “A bit farther out, if you don’t mind. I don’t want to be looking at this thing for the rest of the trip, and I certainly don’t want wolves thinking the edge of our yard is a snack bar.”

Chris nodded his agreement and they carried the deer rather awkwardly about twenty yards into the trees. When they placed it on the ground, Chris looked over to Bear and said: “This is it. I’m not digging a hole for it.”

“May you rest in peace,” Bear said to the corpse, kicking dried leaves up onto it.

They walked together back through the woods to the cabin, where they found Bobby and Noah waiting. Noah gave them both thermoses of coffee which he’d made from water he’d boiled in a kettle and some of the absolute worst instant coffee Chris had ever tasted—another of their purchases from back in Birch. They’d also already taken it upon themselves to get out four rods and reels from the shed, as well as two of the tackle boxes. There were also four mesh folding chairs. and of course, Bobby’s cooler of beer.

All eyes turned towards Bear, as he had done most of the planning. He had known the roads to take out of Birch, the rental plane company to use and, as such, he had also looked around online for trailheads and experiences from previous travelers.

“Lead us through yon wilderness, Daniel Boone,” Bobby joked.

Bear took a piece of paper out of his pocket and unfolded it. It was a simple sheet of notebook paper with a few scrawled directions. He eyed it for a moment and then used an app on his phone for a compass before he started to walk.

“How long of a walk are we talking about?” Noah asked.

Chris could tell the question annoyed Bear. They’d gone over most of this in the SUV between here and Birch. But Bear did his best to hide his irritation as he answered. “Just about a mile. There’s a thin trail somewhere up ahead that should lead us directly to the edge we want to hit up.”

“That’s not so bad,” Bobby said. “Hell, the scenery makes it worth it.”

Chris took note of this, as it was rare that Bobby ever said anything positive without some sort of sarcastic spin. Besides…he was absolutely right. The stripped trees that reached far up into the sky were so closely grown together that they seemed to blend into a canopy overhead. As for the firs and spruces, their luxurious-looking green spreads seemed to almost glow among the cold-stripped nature of everything else. Chris spotted a grove of what he thought were firs a good distance away to their right; the green needles looked like some living, breathing thing way out there.

The sky overhead helped paint the scene as well. It was bright blue, broken up only by a few determined streaks of clouds. The sun was beating down on them, giving the forest a fantastic glow, but it did not feel like much of its heat was reaching them. Still, they had all bundled up, almost to the point of extreme measures. Or, Chris supposed, the exact way someone would expect inexperienced men from California to bundle up in preparation for the frigid Alaskan temperatures.

They walked mostly in silence, as each man appreciated the scenery in their own way. Though the air was cold, there was a crispness to it that Chris found almost intoxicating. It was something more than clean, almost something he could actually taste. It was pure…it was the sort of air that reminded him that the world was not all concrete, smog, and pollution.

They each carried a fishing rod over their shoulders, walking single file down the trail Bear had taken. Chris, bringing up the rear, figured they must look like some weird platoon of soldiers, lost in the wilderness. He again felt a boy-like excitement stirring within him, the same excitement that exists in children racing through the forest with little plastic guns, acting out imaginary wars. He supposed they weren’t much different from that, really. Only Bear had any real experience with the great outdoors and even he would admit his knowledge was limited. And Noah’s one single experience with ice-fishing when he had been a child was probably not going to be much help. In that respect, maybe they were nothing more than little boys venturing out into the unknown for an experience they could take back home to their family and friends.

It took about half an hour for them to reach the edge of Maupin Lake. When they came to the shore and looked out onto the frozen water, another silence fell among them. This one was awed and filled with wonder. Chris thought it was almost like the quiet that fell in a church when the pastor called for prayer.

Further out beyond the flawless expanse of mostly frozen water, there were the white peaks of mountains. They were simple but beautiful, and Chris found himself slightly ashamed that he didn’t know the name of the mountain range he was looking at. The Chigmit Mountains, maybe? He wasn’t sure.

“Wow, guys,” Noah said. “This is beautiful.”

“Yeah, it is,” Bear said. “That ice looks like a perfect crystal, don’t you think?”

“Yeah,” Bobby agreed. “Now let’s go drill some big-ass holes in it.”

One by one, they stepped forward, making their way off of the shore and onto the ice. When both of Chris’s feet were on it, he experimentally stepped forward with great caution. He grinned the entire time, slowly getting used to moving around on the ice in boots that were absolutely not made for traversing a frozen Alaskan Lake. He wondered how the locals would react to the four inexperienced men crossing the frozen lake with basic shoes, warm clothes, and borrowed fishing rods.

Bobby was in the lead, with Bear following close behind. Bear looked back toward the shore now and then, as if judging the distance. After they’d made it out roughly thirty feet, he stopped walking. When he did, it was clear that he was still not quite comfortable walking out onto the ice. He moved slowly as he set his rod and reel down, along with the drill and auger.

“I think we set up here,” he said. “My heavy ass isn’t comfortable going out any farther.”

Bobby nodded and came to a stop, looking at the other three.

Chris was also fine with this, as he was also nervous about stepping out into the ice any further. The only confidence he was taking was in that he could not hear the grinding or crushing of ice beneath his feet.

“Sorry, Bear,” he said. “I didn’t do much research. How thick is this ice we’re on right now?”

“This time of year, in these temperatures, this should be about eight-to-ten feet thick. If we went out another dozen feet or so, it thins out to maybe five feet. Further out than that, it gets risky.”

“So yeah, right here is fine,” Noah said.

They spent the next ten minutes preparing the site. Because it was an entirely new experience, they all took turns drilling into the ice just so each of them could go back home, and be able to say they’d drilled into the ice of an Alaskan lake. The chairs were unfolded and the lures were loaded up. As Noah doled out the artificial bait from the tackle box, Chris looked at his pink and orange bait—called a jiggler, Bear told him—and affixed it to his line.

“Four men venturing into the wilderness only to use fake worms and minnows,” Chris said. “Does it seem a little soft to anyone else?”

“I thought the same thing,” Bear said. “But the guy we’re renting the cabin from said that when it’s this cold, the water under the ice goes a crisp shade of blue. Stale-colored worms or dead minnows and larvae are harder to see. These bright lures are like beacons under there.”

“Fine by me,” Bobby said. “I’m not quite forty and have never hooked a live worm on a hook. I think I could die a happy man if I never do it. Seems sort of weird. A little gross.”

“Then you’re in for a rude awakening when it comes time to scale and gut any fish we catch,” Chris said.

“You a pro, or something?” Noah asked, laughing.

“Not a pro, nope. But I fished a lot with my dad when I was a kid. Scaling, I’m not the best at. But I can gut them pretty well, get them ready to cook up.”

“Don’t take this the wrong way,” Bobby said, “but I find that hard to believe about you.”

Chris said nothing to this as they positioned their chairs around the hole and started to put their lines in. Bear was the last to do so, and when they were done, they settled into their chairs. Slowly, they looked around at one another with a sense of accomplishment. This is what they’d come here for. They’d survived the trip, made it to the cabin, and got finishing lines into the lake, without falling through the ice and drowning.

Chris felt remarkably accomplished.

Sure, watching four fishing rods bob slightly in front of them seemed anticlimactic, but they also seemed to share the same realization that this was not so much about the fishing. It was about the escapism of it all, the wonder of the scenery. Chris looked away from the rods and his friends, peering across the desolate frozen lake and felt truly peaceful for the first time in several years.

---

By noon, they’d caught eight fish. But they’d also started to understand that the bitter cold was nothing to mess around with. Chris knew they’d done their best at dressing well. Looking across at Noah, he could only truly see his friend’s eyes and the bridge of his nose. Everything else on his head was covered in masks and caps. Like Chris, Noah was wearing a thin set of gloves underneath the heavily insulated second pair. Snow bibs, thermals, and, in Chris’s case, a pair of jogging pants in between had seemed like enough when they set out in the morning. But there was something about sitting on the field of ice, out in the open, that made it so much colder. It was almost like the cold air served as a blanket for the colder-still surface of the lake.

Bobby had started drinking at eleven o’clock. He’d used the excuses of celebrating his first catch and a means to keep warm. Noah had joined in soon after and Chris was pretty sure it was just so Bobby didn’t feel singled out or alienated. Chris respected the choice but would be damned if he’d do such a thing just so Bobby felt that he wasn’t sticking out in any negative way.

Bear was in the middle of griping about the way his school was being run, particularly about state-mandated tests that stripped kids of their individuality, when Bobby got out of his chair. He walked a few feet away from the group without any announcement, as if he’d done it hundreds of times before.

“What are you doing?” Bear asked, his grievances interrupted.

“Got to take a leak.”

“On the ice?” Chris said.

“Bear said this stuff is at least eight feet thick.” He’d turned his back to them and starting to pull at the bibs around his waist. “I doubt a little piss is going to make us fall in the lake.”

“Yeah, but…still, man,” Bear said.

Chris, Bear, and Noah all shared a look that was mostly of good humor, but there was some annoyance to it as well. It was a feeling that only intensified among them when Bobby came back and retrieved another beer from the cooler—his fourth so far. He also opened up a pack of crackers and started munching on them. As he did, he made a very dramatic presentation of shivering.

“How much longer do you guys’ plan on being out here?” he asked. “It’s cold as hell and the smell of fish is starting to get to me.”

“I figure another couple of hours,” Bear said. “Everyone okay with that?”

“Good with me,” Noah said. Chris nodded in agreement.

“Two more hours of this and you can use my balls as lures because they will have frozen off,” Bobby said. “And unlike you fellas, I still need mine from time to time.”

Chris felt a comment bubbling up and knew he should keep it quiet. But it was already crawling over his tongue before he could stop it. “Well, I’m sure if you pound a few more beers, the cold won’t bother you all that much.”

Bobby raised an eyebrow and studied Chris for a while, trying to see if he’d been attacked or if it had been a good-natured rib. When he couldn’t quite decide, he simply grinned maliciously at him and raised his middle finger. He then made a showing of chugging the rest of his beer, tossing the empty can out onto the ice and then instantly grabbing another. He held the can out toward Chris as he popped the tab.

“Come on, Bobby,” Bear said. “That’s a bit much.”

“But also par for the course,” Chris added.

Would you please just shut up? He asked himself. Are you trying to start an argument?

“What’s your problem, anyway?” Bobby asked. “First back at the store yesterday and now this? You’re not my Daddy. If you wanted to play Daddy, you should have stayed at home with the family. Seems you—”

But Bobby stopped , shutting his mouth quickly. It seemed that even on his way to getting drunk; he had more control over his tongue that Chris did. He seemed to understand that he’d probably gone a little too far.

“Seems I what?”

Bobby shook his head and looked at the fishing lines, still bobbing in the hole in the lake. “Nothing man.” He got to his feet and grabbed his cooler. He then picked up the chair, pressed it down against the ice, and folded it in on itself. “Not a single thing. I’m out, guys. I’m heading back to the cabin. I’ll make sure the fire’s going when you get there.”

“C’mon, man,” Noah said. “Don’t be like that.”

Bobby had already started walking, though. This time, he strode back to the shore with confidence in each icy step. “It’s cool,” he called over his shoulder. “I don’t want to bring the freezing fun vibe of this fishing trip down.”

They watched him go, cooler swaying in one hand, beer can in another. Not bothering to take his pole back, I see, Chris noted. Selfish prick.

When Bobby was out of earshot, Bear sighed and looked to Chris. “Look, he gets on my nerves, too. But you know him as well as I do. You push him, he’s just going to get worse. And he’s going to do it on purpose, and that’s about one hundred times worse than his natural tendencies.”

“I know. I just…I don’t know. He’s been rubbing me the wrong way lately. And you know what? Maybe it is jealousy. There are days I come home and I would love nothing more than to kill a six-pack and not have to deal with an eight-year-old daughter who wants to tell me twenty stories in the space of five minutes, or a distant wife, or a mortgage. It sucks to admit it, but there it is.”

“I get it,” Bear said. “He’ll grow out of it. If he doesn’t, he’s going to come to a rough spot that is going to wake him up.”

Noah gave a shudder, and not because of the cold. “Man. Trying to imagine Bobby Valencia at rock bottom is jarring.” He paused for a moment before quietly asking: “He’s going to be okay, right? I saw my old man lose a battle with alcoholism and it was terrible. He died from prostate cancer, begging for a drink in his last hour.”

“Nah, I don’t think Bobby’s that bad,” Bear said. “He can function when he wants to. He just likes to have fun and is terrified of growing up.”

They all looked back towards the shore where, a few feet past the frozen water’s edge, it looked like the tall, gnarled trees were swallowing Bobby. And deep down in his heart, Chris could not deny that he very much wished that was the case.`,

      content: `Chris, Bear, and Noah arrived back at the cabin shortly after four o’clock that evening. In addition to the poles, chairs and tackle box, they also carried a cheap plastic cooler (also pilfered from the storage shed behind the cabin). They filled the cooler with the day’s catches, which had come to a total of fourteen fish—much more than Chris had been expecting. They’d taken selfies out on the ice with their catches, and for a while, it felt like an epic men’s wilderness expedition. They were men. They did what they came here to do, and now it was time to go to the cabin and eat the day’s catch.

Before descaling and gutting the fish for dinner, they headed inside to thaw out in front of the fire and to drink copious cups of bitter coffee. They were inside for no more than three minutes before anyone realized that Bobby wasn’t there. There was plenty of evidence that he had been there, though: wet tracks by the back door, the wrapper for an oatmeal pie sitting on the counter, and the fire had been stoked.

But as for Bobby himself, there was no sign.

“Well, he couldn’t have gone off very far,” Noah said. “It’s cold as hell out there and he doesn’t have the best sense of direction.”

“That’s what concerns me,” Bear said. “Remember what Jay said: there are even locals that can get lost and turned around in these woods. A half-drunken Bobby out there doesn’t paint a pretty picture.”

Chris agreed and, though he was irritated beyond belief with Bobby, understood the danger he could be in. He thought of the wolves they’d heard last night and the fact that there were potential grizzly bears out there as well. He did his best to ward off the creeping worry building up in his guts as he downed his second cup of coffee. In order to keep his wits about him, he got to his feet and looked to Bear and Noah.

“You guys get the grill started and I’ll work on the fish.”

Bear seemed a little perturbed that he was overlooking Bobby, but then seemed to understand. He nodded and stood up from the couch, getting his coat from the hook by the back door. He didn’t look particularly thrilled about the situation, but he wasn’t in freak-out mode just yet. Chris was pretty sure he was seeing what Bear must look like when dealing with unruly kids at school.

Noah, though, apparently a little slow today, looked at both of them as if they were the cruelest people on earth. “What about Bobby?”

“If he’s nearby, he’ll smell the fish cooking on the grill had come back,” Bear said. “If he’s too far away to smell it, there’s little we can do for him. It’s not like we can call the police. If you haven’t noticed, there’s no cell service out here. I hate to say it, but I’m pretty sure he’s just lurking right around the edges of the woods, along the yard. He just wants some attention.”

The more Bear went on, the more dire the situation felt to Chris. By the time he went out the back door with a few knives from the silverware drawer, he was starting to feel the first true pangs of fear. He saw the slaughtered deer by their front door in his mind’s eye, and it was all too easy to superimpose Bobby’s face onto it.

Where did that idiot go? he wondered as he set out to prepare the fish for dinner.

As he started scaling the fish outside on a cutting board that had clearly been used for similar activities in the past, his mind started to wonder exactly what Bobby could have gotten into. Had he realized what an ass he’d been and tried to come back out to the lake, only he’d been unable to find it? It would be pretty hard to miss the trail leading to the lake, though Bobby ha been close to drunk when he’d left them—and it was a pretty respectable distance to walk. Bobby could have walked half a mile, thinking he’d gone three and then turned around. Chris figured if this was the case, there might be enough scant snow and frost on the ground to show some evidence of his footsteps if they wanted to go out searching.

When Bear and Noah had the grill going, charcoal alight and burning, they came over to the butcher board to help. Chris wasn’t at all surprised to find that Bear knew how to scale, gut, and properly prepare a fish. They had a dozen filleted fish ready in a surprisingly short amount of time. He wasn’t aware of how hungry he truly was until Bear put the filets on the grill and the aroma drifted up into the air. He hated that they didn’t have any seasoning to properly flavor the meat, but he supposed you were supposed to forgo such extravagances when you were roughing it.

When the fish was ready, they ate quietly inside with only ketchup to flavor the fish. They were each drinking a beer, but the conversation was lagging, weighed down by Bobby’s absence. The grilled fish was much better than Chris had expected and it almost took his mind off of Bobby. He peered through the window and saw how quickly it was getting dark. True nightfall would be on them in less than an hour.

“I think we need to go out looking for Bobby,” Chris said, hating to admit it out loud. “If it gets dark, and he’s still not back…”

“Yeah, it’s getting more and more dangerous the longer he’s not here,” Bear said. “Damn it, we should have gone looking earlier.”

“How long do you think he’ been gone?” Noah asked.

“Let’s say he left the cabin an hour after he got back from the lake,” Chris said, looking to his watch. “If that’s the case, he’s been out there for almost four hours by himself.”

“And even if he left moments before we got here and we just missed him by a few minutes,” Bear said, “that would be two hours.”

Noah crossed his arms and looked over toward the door. “Okay, I’ll go ahead and say it…I’m scared for him.”

Bear shoved an immense piece of fish into his mouth and got to his feet. “Me, too. So if we go looking for him, I think one of us should stay here just in case he comes back. I’ll drive back down the road toward Birch and see if I can find him. And if not, I guess I’ll go all the way into town and see if I can call a—”

He was interrupted by a banging noise from the front porch. It startled all three of them, and for one paralyzing moment, Chris knew without a doubt that it would be Bobby’s butchered body. Just like the deer from this morning, something would have killed and gutted him, delivering his corpse to their front door.

But then there was another thumping noise, followed by the rattling of the doorknob. With a shriek of wood-on-wood, the front door opened and Bobby stepped into the cabin. He looked to them, smiled widely, and then stepped inside. He hesitated for a moment, made a pff sound, and then turned back to the door after realizing he’d left it open. When he closed it, he slammed it and cackled a bit.

“Hey there, mighty fishermen,” Bobby said. It was clear from those three words and the two lumbering steps he took that he was drunk. Very drunk. He was carrying one of the cabin’s cheap plastic coolers in his right hand. It swayed the same way his legs did as he took another step forward. His nose was red and though he looked a bit tired and worn down, there seemed to be a bit of muted joy in his eyes. Chris looked back to the cooler. He figured it had likely been full whenever Bobby had ventured out but was now either empty of filled with drained beer cans.

“Where have you been, Bobby?” Bear asked with a bit of a growl in his voice.

“Walking.” Bobby came over to the table and dropped the cooler on the floor. The lid came slightly askew and sure enough, Chris saw at least three opened and empty cans at the top.

“You could have left a note or something,” Chris said. “We were about five minutes away from coming out to look for you.”

“Aww, that’s sweet,” Bobby said. He cackled childishly as he sat down at the small kitchen table with them. “But, I didn’t know I had a curfew.”

“No need to be an ass about it,” Bear said. “Just…just shut up and eat.”

Chris, though, wasn’t about to be so forgiving. “So you just decided to go out and walk around these cold, unfamiliar woods by yourself? No note, no message of any kind. Screw us, right? Just let us worry?”

“Hey…I figured I’d give the scenery another chance. I thought it might be nicer without you jerks ruining it for me.”

“Was it?” Bear asked, still snippy, but not quite confrontational.

“Sure,” Bobby said, reaching out and grabbing up a piece of fish. “Not sure which way I went. West, I think. Got a good shot of the mountains. Tell you, though, I think Bear is right about the grizzlies.” He chomped at the fish and gave them a wide-eyed look. “I saw three other deer, just mauled to pieces. A wolf, too. That’s what got me to come back. That wolf’s face had been pulverized.”

“Wait,” Noah said. “You mean like the deer this morning?”

Bobby nodded drunkenly, swaying a bit. He smiled maniacally and swayed a bit more, leaning against the wall while still seated at the table. “This wolf, though…the face was all smashed up. Its teeth…they were everywhere, man!” He then shifted his eyes drastically at Bear and Chris. “That’s what got me back. Well, that and the curfew I apparently have. What did you morons think? That I wandered off into woods all sad because we’d had a fight? Neither of you is worth that.”

The tone of his voice indicated that he was joking, but something about it stirred Chris up. Rather than saying things he might later regret, he stood up from the table and started heading toward his room.

“You heading off for a walk alone in the woods, too?” Bobby asked.

“No. Just going to my room.”

“Ah, don’t leave, man! I didn’t mean to come in and break up this beautiful dinner party. Come on back to the table.”

“No, I’m good.”

Chris continued back to his room, though the boiling irritation inside of him was begging to be let out, to just lay into the selfish display Bobby was putting on. He couldn’t remember ever feeling so angry at a single person. But some other part of him was pretty sure Bobby wanted someone to react to him. He wanted the attention, just like Bear had suggested moments ago. And Chris did not want to be the person to give it to him.

“Hold on,” Bobby said, raising his voice. He stood up on wobbly, drunken legs and looked around the room as if a bomb had gone off. “Is this what this trip is really going to be like?” The words “is this” came out in a drunker slur, sounding like Izzis. “I know you guys are a few years older than me and you’re all married and sad, but can’t we have some fun?”

“That’s what we’ve been trying to do, Bobby,” Bear said.

“So why is everyone so mad at me? Fun looks…it looks different for me. I mean, look at you…all of you! What’s next? We going to start knitting and playing Bridge? Want to put on some records and dance with each other to Patsy Cline?”

“Bobby…” Noah said. “Come on, man. Calm down.”

But Chris had seen Bobby like this before. He was drunk and had already started a rant. He wasn’t going to be silenced until he got it all out—for better or for worse. He got to his feet again, glaring at them.

“I thought you all wanted to get out and have some fun!” Bobby then looked directly at Chris and, with a sinister smile, added: “Especially you, Chris. I thought the problems at home would mean you’d be cutting it up hard out here.”

Chris turned, his face going red. The anger was now massaging his heart, begging him to let it out. It wasn’t just the accusation, but the fact that Bobby knew.

“What did you just say to me?”

“Your problems at home,” Bobby said. “We all know about them. I mean, you won’t come out and say it, but we know. We can tell. All three of us. It’s Vicki, right?”

Bear had placed his hands on the table, as if he was prepared to stand up and act if the moment called for it. “Bobby, why don’t you just shut up? Sit down, drink another beer and—”

“No, let him talk,” Chris said, taking a huge step back towards the table. Vicki had been mentioned. And though it made him furious, he was also wondering if he’d slipped up at some point and made a subtle comment about his suspicions. How did they all know? Was it really as obvious as Bobby was saying?

“Chris…” Bear warned.

“Let me hear what this loser has to say about how to properly live a life,” Chris said, his voice now close to a yell. “Let’s hear Bobby tell us how we’re supposed to keep a wife happy, how to keep the same woman for life. I’d love to hear it.”

Bobby smiled even harder now, the grin almost seeming to stretch his face out beyond its limits. It was proof that he had just set a trap and Chris had fallen right into it.

“Oh, see, that’s the thing, Chris. I do know how to keep your wife happy.”

“You son of—” Chris started.

Bear was up in a heartbeat, shoving Bobby back down into his chair. “Funny man, Bobby. Do you understand what you’re even saying now? You can’t just talk shit about a man’s wife like that and—”

But Bobby let out a huge laugh, boisterous, and from deep in his chest. He then stood back up again, looked around the whole room, and finally settled his eyes back on Chris. Those eyes were hazy from the booze, but there was a weird sort of crystal clarity in them now.

“Oh, I’m not trying to be funny,” Bobby said. “Vicki is cheating on him. And she’s doing it with me.”

Bear looked appalled at the joke, and Noah had a very uncertain smile on his face. Bobby took one more step towards Chris and cocked his head. “I’m not joking,” he said, his voice a whisper now, his eyes like flints of rock. “Tell me, Chris…that little birthmark about an inch or so below her belly button…it looks a little like the state of New York, doesn’t it?”

Chris supposed the sensation that enveloped him in the following moments was an unadulterated and totally pure form of fury. It bloomed through him like molten lava, and when it spread through him: it was almost orgasmic. He felt himself being propelled across the room, but could not feel his feet moving. He knew his right arm was coming back, his fingers clenching into the shape of a fist, but he couldn’t feel it.

It all came crashing back in a flood of tangible anger when his right arm came sailing forward. His fist struck Bobby squarely in the jaw. The sound was almost like music—a crack, a snap, and then silence waiting for another beat.

Later, Chris would look back on the moment and realize that both Bear and Noah had allowed him to get the first punch in. They both believed that the single punch, at the very least, was owed to him. The moment after his fist connected, Bobby went sprawling back against the table. Noah then grabbed Bobby and Bear came at Chris, catching him in a restraint that was impossible to budge in, much less get out of.

Chris felt a scream of rage rise up inside of him, but Bear’s voice was in his ear, speaking calmly. “Let it go. I know it’s wrong and you want to hurt him, but he’s not worth how it will make you feel tomorrow. You know I’m right.”

Chris struggled against Bear for a moment, his back to his massive friend’s chest. He let out one growl of frustration and then stopped. Besides, what the hell was he fighting for? If Bobby was the kind of man Vicki wanted, let them have each other. He’d confront her on it as soon as they got home, start the divorce proceedings, and quickly start working toward seeking custody of Brianna.

As Bear started hauling Chris back towards his room, Noah was dragging Bobby to the back door—maybe to get him on the back porch to cool off. Through it all, Chris didn’t fight Bear. In fact, he didn’t move so much as a muscle, even when Bobby started to laugh as he was carted outside into the dark cold of night.`,

      content: `“So what do you want to do?” Bear asked.

It was 10:15. Chris and Bear were outside, sitting around the firepit. Chris was drinking a beer, but only because he needed it to calm down. Bear looked like a concerned father, his eyes darting back and forth from Chris and then to the dark woods all around them. On occasion, he’d look back to the cabin as if he were worried Bobby would come back out to start more trouble.

“I don’t know,” Chris said. “I don’t want to make everyone end the trip short, but I just don’t see how I can wrap this trip up with Bobby here. Maybe in the morning, I’ll have someone give me a ride out to the airstrip. I know it wastes half a day for whoever takes me and there will be additional cost to the trip with the extra airfare, but I think it’s the only way for it to work.”

“That’s noble of you, but there’s no way that’s going to happen. Things will be tense between the three of us if you leave. I’d much rather Bobby leave, but I don’t want to give him the ammunition to play the victim.”

“Okay, so what then? I mean this sincerely…but I am open to any ideas you have.”

“I have one, but first…I have to ask: is there any chance he’s lying?”

“Maybe. But…I’ve ha suspicions that Vicki has been cheating for a while now. And that detail about her birth mark…it’s spot on. I don’t know how else he’d know.”

Bear nodded, digesting it. Chris could tell that he was pretty much forcing himself to accept it as a fact. “Then I think we all just call it a day tomorrow. Head out early. It can’t be too hard to catch flights back on short notice, right? Besides…I think our friend Jay would like to see us again.” He tried the last bit as comic relief, but it fell flat.

“I just don’t want to be the reason the trip ends early,” Chris said.

“You’re not. That would be Bobby.” Bear sighed and shrugged, his eyes wandering back out to the forest. “Maybe we were wrong to bring him out here with us.”

“There’s no way any of us could have known it would be this bad. Well, maybe I should have known. But…well, I’m apparently not the most attentive husband.”

“Don’t you dare do that to yourself.”

Chris gave his own lazy shrug as he drank from his beer and looked out into the tangles of trees and darkness all around them. He then looked back at the cabin. Inside, Bobby was passed out on the couch, and Noah was standing guard, making sure Bobby didn’t wake up and go searching for Chris to start more trouble.

“How do I even go back home after this?” Chris said. “I swear, if I didn’t have Brianna back there waiting for, I’d go somewhere else.”

“Well, if we’re ending this trip early, I’d hope you’d take me with you.”

“Sure. Maybe Iceland. I’ve always wanted to go.”

“Then let’s do it. We’ll end this one early and then when you get your stuff straightened out back at home, we’ll get to it. Maybe we’ll even invite Noah.”

“And we can leave the—”

He was cut off by the sound of something shifting very close by out in the forest. It was the sound of something moving quietly—a deer, perhaps. After what they’d discovered on their front stoop this morning, the idea of a deer being just a few yards away didn’t do much to ease Chris’s mind. Both men turned in that direction and whatever was out there seemed to sense their eyes on it. The sound of its movement continued, but the noise tapered off. Whatever it was, it was moving away from them.

For a moment, it seemed this was the end of the occurrence. Chris was already turning back towards the fire when he heard another noise. This one sent a chill racing down his spine for reasons he could not quite identify. It sounded almost like someone clearing their throat, only there was something deeper to it, something more primal.

Chris turned back towards the forest, but he also stood up out of his chair at the same time, ready to haul ass back inside. Bear remained in his seat, though he was sitting much more rigidly than he had moments before. He was also staring out to the forest, unmoving.

“Was that a bear?” Chris asked.

“No clue. It sounded pretty close, didn’t it?”

“I don’t know. I think so. I think it—”

The sound came again, and this time it sounded much more like a human. It was clearer this time, almost like a cough. Yet, it was clearly not a human; Chris knew this with a sort of ingrained certainty that continued to allow that chill to run its course through his body.

“That’s not a bear,” Bear said. The humor of the comment coming from a friend that everyone called Bear didn’t strike Chris as humorous. Nothing was anywhere near funny at that moment.

“Anything else out in those woods that might make those noises?”

“What do I look like, a wildlife expert?” Bear said. Then, a few seconds later, he added: “I know that owls can make some pretty weird noises when they get spooked, but it’s too cold out here for owls.”

The noise came again, this time accompanied with the snapping of twigs. Whatever it was, it was headed further out into the woods, apparently scared off by their voices.

“I’m not sure what it is,” Bear said. “But it’s more than enough reason for us to go back inside, that’s for sure.”

“Agreed.”

Chris picked up the little bucket of water they’d been keeping by the firepit and extinguished the flames. As it hiss and crackled and little plumes of smoke rose into the air, they walked to the back porch. Before heading inside, Bear stopped Chris for a moment. In the dark, confined to the small, cramped space of the back porch and standing so close together, Chris was reminded of just how big Barret “Bear” Thompson truly was.

“Let’s be real here,” Bear said. “Between you and Bobby, you’re the most emotionally mature one. God only knows what sort of state Bobby is going to be in when he wakes up. If he mentions this thing with Vicki or tries to get under your skin, I need you to be the bigger man. Don’t rise to it. You got a punch in earlier, and let’s leave it at that.”

Chris hated to be spoken down to, but he knew Bear was right. It was going to be hard enough to figure out how to bring this disastrous trip to an end. Endless bickering with Bobby was only going to make it that much harder.

“I promise absolutely nothing,” Chris said. “But I will try my best.”

That seemed good enough for Bear. He opened the door, and both men walked inside where the warmth of the fire instantly did its work. Chris drank the rest of his beer, tossed the empty can in the trashcan, and grabbed a bottled water from the fridge. As he twisted the cap off, he looked over at the sofa. From the kitchen, he couldn’t see Bobby, but he could hear him snoring. Noah sat in the small armchair across from the sofa, reading a book by the fire. He glanced up at Chris almost apologetically and then turned his attention back to the pages.

“G’night,” Chris said coolly as he walked towards his room.

“You, okay?”

“I’m fine.” Yet, when he walked into his room, he had to restrain himself from slamming the door.

With the door closed, he nearly threw the water bottle against the wall. He’d been fine outside, even when spooked by those noises coming from the woods. But the moment he’d heard those loud, booze-fueled snores from the couch, the rage had come rushing back. He supposed he needed to figure out if the anger was more directed towards Bobby or at Vicki. Right now, he supposed it felt more directed towards Bobby because he was right there.

He chugged more water and then realized he’d be going to bed without brushing his teeth. He honestly didn’t much care. Maybe that was supposed to be part of “roughing it” anyway. All he knew for sure was that if he spent any more time on the other side of his bedroom door, he was going to cause a scene. And Bear was right: if they were going to make it back home without any drama—be it tomorrow or in a few days, whichever they decided upon—it would be up to him.

Sitting on the edge of the bed, Chris grabbed his wallet from the bedside table. He kept two pictures in it (because, really, who kept pictures in wallets anymore?) just for the novelty of it. One featured himself and Brianna, the other with Vicki and Brianna. He stared at his daughter’s face and started to think of what her life was going to be like when he got back home. She was going to be pulled through a divorce and Chris was going to have to figure out a way to get through. Even now, as angry as he could ever remember being in his life, the idea of Brianna finding out what her mother had done pained him. He wasn’t sure he’d ever be able to bring himself to tell her.

I love you, baby girl, he thought, running his hand over the picture. He then tossed the wallet back on the table, turned out the lights, and fell into bed.

It took him a very long time to fall asleep. He spent much of that time trying to figure out when Vicki and Bobby had been hooking up. Had she been meeting with him when she claimed she’d been going to the gym? Had she managed to find time to screw him when he’d been away at conferences and she was supposed to be watching their daughter? Or maybe it had been every single night when she claimed she’d had to work late. And beyond that, there were other paralyzing questions, namely ifd she let Bobby do things with her that she had always refused of him?

It all burned like coals in his guts, and sleep didn’t come for a very long time. When it did, it fell on him like razors, taking him painfully. It was such a disjointed and broken sleep that at several points during the night, Chris thought he could hear that odd throat-clearing voice outside his window, carried by the sound of heavy footsteps.

Once, when he came out of sleep, he thought he could hear the crashing of cars, the wind of a hurricane, the moaning of his wife enjoying the feel of another man.

But the blanket of sleep kept the harder edges of those sounds and nightmares away for the most part. They were distant, like faraway thunder. The closest one seemed to be the noise he and Bear had heard out in the woods, something that almost sounded human. And now and then, he would turn fitfully in bed, as if turning away from something his sleeping mind thought might actually be in the room with him.`,

      content: `Chris stirred awake by shouting—not arguing or screaming, just a raised voice that was sounded annoyed. He recognized the voice as Bobby’s right away. Bear and Noah were also speaking, but quieter. It seemed like they were trying to calm Bobby down. He heard footsteps walking towards the kitchen area, the fridge opening, and then slamming shut again.

Chris sat up in bed and was about to get out when there was a knock at his bedroom door. His sleepy mind snapped fully awake at once, assuming this would be Bobby wanting to pick up where they’d left off last night. Bobby had never been one to let a grudge lie, and last night’s events had certainly evolved into something more than a simple grudge.

“One minute,” Chris called.

“It’s Bear,” came the response. “You dressed? Can I come in?”

“Yeah.”

Bear opened the door and slipped inside quickly. He looked tired. His hair was wiry and sticking up all over his head, indicating he had not been awake for very long. He closed the door behind him and stood in front of it with his arms crossed, letting out a very heavy sigh.

“Remember that talk we had about you being the grown up?”

“Yeah. What about it?”

“I need you to really stick to that. Because, quite frankly, I want to kill him.”

“Why? Jesus, what did I miss?”

“Well, luckily, Noah was up first. He was eating breakfast when Bobby got up. He said Bobby went to the bathroom, took a piss, and then said he wanted to go home—got really mean about it. We told him that was fine, that we’d try to arrange something to get him home. But then he said he wanted to fight you first. He said maybe the winner would be the one to stay.”

“Are you serious?”

“Yeah. Seems sort of middle-school-playground to me.”

“Yeah, it does,” Chris agreed. “But still, I’m all for that. I’d love to deck him again.”

“You’re as crazy as he is if you think I’m going to allow that.”

“At the risk of sounding insensitive, maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. He needs his ass kicked. Maybe if I beat him in front of you and Noah, it would be the slice of humble pie he needs. He’ll be moping around and pouting for the rest of the trip, but he has his beer to console him.”

“Trust me, I’ve thought about it—letting you two go at it. I know you can take him. But we’re in the middle of nowhere.” Bear made a vague gesture around them to prove his point. “If one of you got seriously hurt, I don’t even know what it would look like trying to get you to a hospital.”

“Is that what he’s being so loud about right now?” Chris asked.

“Yes. That, and he said he didn’t sleep well last night. He swears there was a bear or something on the front porch.”

Chris almost commented that he thought he’d heard something outside last night as well, but kept it quiet. He was pretty sure everything he’d heard had all been dreams. Besides, while he thought he’d heard the noises from the woods last night, he’d also thought he heard cars crashing and the sounds of his wife enjoying another man. He’d likely imagined all of it.

“Fine,” Chris said. “So, what do you need out of me?”

“Like I said, I need you to be the grownup. I need you to not punch him and not take his bait. It’s best if we just try to get out of here today. We’ll get to Birch and call the airstrip to see if we can get Jay to take us out of here a few days early. We might need to stay in a motel while we wait, but it’s better for you and Bobby to be in separate rooms instead of sharing a cabin in the woods.”

Chris felt those hot coals stirring in his guts again. His wife’s unfaithfulness had somehow followed him here and ruined his trip. Yes, Bobby’s wretched lifestyle had also played a factor and Chris once again could not decide who to be angrier with. After all, Bobby had never stood before a preacher and their families and taken a vow to never sleep with his wife.

“Can you get on board with that?” Bear asked.

“Yes. I just hate that this is what’s causing this trip to end.”

“I know. It would be cooler if one of us fell in an icy lake or got mauled by some wild animal or something. But…it is what it is.”

“Yeah,” Chris said. He nodded to the door and said, “I’ll be out in a second.”

Bear nodded and exited the room quickly. Things on the other side seemed to have gotten quiet for now. Chris grabbed up some clothes and his toiletries bag and left the room, headed for the bathroom. The living area was nice and warm, made cozy by the fire. As he made his way to the bathroom, he saw Noah and Bobby standing in the kitchen. Bobby glared at him and when they two locked eyes, Noah made a point to step in front of Bobby, breaking their gaze. Chris then entered the bathroom and went about his business.

While in the shower, he felt the first real pangs of sorrow. It was one thing to suspect your wife was cheating, but quite another to have it confirmed. Not only that, but to know who her lover was and to have to face him. It was an odd sort of sorrow, though, tinged with a sort of anger that almost made him feel nauseous. He did his best to shove it deeper inside, to keep it tucked away until he was back home and could deal with it without the threat of beating the absolute hell out of Bobby.

He had just cut the water off when he heard more loud talking from the living room. This time, unlike when he’d just woken up, he did hear anger in it. Bear sounded furious and when Noah responded, Chris thought he could hear fear in his voice. As he dried off, Chris could hear fragments of the conversation and it made no sense.

“…because it didn’t just happen! Someone had to have done it!” He was pretty sure this was Bear, trying to restrain himself from crossing over into absolute anger.

“Well, no shit,” Bobby responded. “Did it ever occur to you that it might have been the same messed up individual that put that butchered deer on our porch yesterday?”

“Maybe he’s right,” Noah said. “I mean…we’re strangers, in the middle of nowhere. Maybe locals or even teens out of Birch that know these woods really well are messing with us. It’s the only proper explanation.”

“Well, if that’s the case, heads are going to roll,” Bear spat. “This is destruction of property. I mean…do you two even know what this means?”

“It means we’re screwed,” Bobby said, his voice bouncing between amusement and fear.

As Chris slid into his clothes, he couldn’t help but get a little spooked himself. Bear had mentioned the deer on the porch from yesterday. And, according to Bobby, they’re screwed. Just what in the hell had happened while he was in the shower?

He stepped out of the bathroom, his hair still wet and his teeth still unbrushed. All three of the other men turned to look at him and he saw a mix of emotion on their faces: fear, confusion, anger.

“What is it?” Chris spoke, still rubbing a towel against his temple.

“The truck,” Noah said, looking towards the front door.

“Have a look,” Bear said, opening the front door. Fury and terror meshing on his tongue, his words were soaked in them

Chris walked in that direction, passing by Bobby as he did so. He braced himself as he passed because he could feel the tension between them like invisible steel. It was almost enough to make him forget about the uneasiness that had suddenly enveloped the room. When he passed through the front door, the chill slapped him square in the face, made worse because his hair was still wet. But the chill became something else entirely when he saw what the other three had been so up in arms over. He took just one step towards it but then stopped as he started top understand what it meant.

The hood of the SUV was open. And though it took Chris a while to figure out what he was seeing, there was blood everywhere. For a moment, it looked as if the truck was bleeding.

“What the hell?” he said as he slid his feet into his boots, right by the door. He stormed outside to get a better look and it all began to make a grotesque sort of sense.

Part of a dead animal had been shoved down into the contents of the hood. Mangled, bloody fur and shattered bones had been crammed down between the engine housing and the plastic container that held the radiator fluid. The container had been punctured, and the fluid had leaked out onto the ground. He also saw where a few cables had been sliced in half, including the cables that ran to the battery. And while all of that was bad enough, his eyes went back to the animal.

Like the deer, it seemed to have been gutted viciously. This animal was not a deer, though; it was much smaller. Chris saw what he thought was a tail, fringed with white, making him think it was a fox. It was hard to be sure because there was no head and the fur was discolored because of the blood.

There were three legs remaining, a slight curve of chest that went upwards to where there was no longer a neck or head. Bone, tissue and raw chunks of meat Chris could not identify all glistened next to the engine like some weird hybrid machine. The rest of the fox had been removed by what looked like a very rough hacking job. What had been left behind was shoved like oily rags down into the inner workings of the SUV.

When Chris could finally tear his eyes away from the remains of the fox, he saw something else that alarmed him. And while it looked more natural, it seemed far more lethal than the half-a-fox.

The hood had not simply been popped open; it had been pulled open with significant force. The hinge on the right, at the top near the windshield, had been totally torn free, the hood sitting slightly askew. He then looked to the front, near the grill, and saw that the catch that kept the hood closed had been snapped in half. Someone had opened the hood with incredible force.

“You got any ideas?” Noah asked from behind him.

Chris turned and saw all three of them standing in the doorway. Bear and Noah were in the front, with Bobby peeking in from behind them.

“The mauled fox is bad enough,” he said. “But did you see the shape of the hood?”

“Yeah,” Bear said, joining him out by the SUV. “Someone pulled it open. It wasn’t just popped by the handle inside. The hinges are snapped.”

“So is the clasp,” Chris said, tapping at the busted hood-catch just on the inside of the frame.

“You think someone could have done it with a crowbar or something?” Noah asked.

“Maybe.”

“But probably not,” Bear added. “There are no dents or scratches where they would have pried for leverage. No…this thing was just pulled open.”

“That had to have been one strong sucker,” Noah said.

“Or a very determined bear.”

“So, this obviously presents two questions, right?” Noah said. “First, who the hell did this?”

“And I suppose the second would be why, right?” Chris said.

“One hell of a why.”

“And here’s a third one for you,” Bobby said, nudging his way out onto the porch. He was holding his cellphone in his hand and shaking his head. “What are we supposed to do now? It’s not like we can actually call someone for help. I don’t know about you boys, but I’ve got absolutely zero signal out here.”

It was a good question, and one they had no immediate answer for. All four of them stared at the SUV, at the pried-open hood and the carcass of the fox jammed inside. Severed battery cables and other damaged parts under the hood only added to it all, but it equated to one simple thing: they were stranded.`,

      content: `“Okay, hold on,” Bear said, rubbing at his head as he turned away from the sight of the SUV and the grisly gift that had been shoved under the hood. “Yes, this sucks, but there’s no need to freak out.”

“I don’t know,” Noah said, still looking at the fox. “I’m pretty freaked out.”

“Remember what Jay said. He talked about rescue station spread out all along these roads, right?”

“That’s right,” Bobby said, suddenly hopeful. He was still looking at his cell phone as if it had severely failed him. “But I don’t know if we passed one on the way out here. I don’t remember seeing one. Then again, I wasn’t really paying much attention or looking for one.”

Big surprise there, Chris thought.

“I think I saw one,” Noah said. “It was this little hut sort of tucked back in the trees, just a little off the road. Too small to be a cabin or a house.”

“You know about how far back?” Chris asked.

“No.” He stood silent for a moment, trying to remember. “Maybe halfway between here and the main road. But that’s just a guess.”

“Isn’t there a trail map somewhere in the car?” Noah said.

“Sure is,” Bear said, instantly making his way to the passenger side door. He opened it up and popped open the glove compartment. After a few moments of rummaging around, he brought out a small trail map, just slightly larger than a sheet of notebook paper.

Having no hood to perch the map on, he walked over to the porch, where they all huddled around it. The wood was still stained with blood from the deer the morning before. As they looked at the map, something in Chris’s mind seemed to snap to attention as a sudden realization came to him.

“Oh my God…”

“What?” Bear and Bobby asked in near-unison.

He thought it over for a minute, wanting to make sure he wasn’t just jumping to conclusions. Even when he did begin to speak, the words came slowly.

“Last night, I didn’t sleep very well. I had these sorts of flashes of dreams and just random noises, you know, sort of just audio dreams, if that makes sense.” He paused here as Vicki’s moans and gasps suddenly came to mind, much louder than they’d been in his dreams. “One thing I heard was sort of like two cars crashing together. I thought I might have dreamed of a car accident or something, but…it didn’t sound quite right.” He nodded to the slightly mangled hood of the SUV and said, “I think that’s what I heard. Whenever that thing was yanked up, I heard it right outside my window.”

It didn’t sound as crazy as he’d feared now that it was out, but no one said anything about it. Instead, Bear slowly turned everyone’s attention back to the map. He found the lake easily and then trailed his finger along to their cabin.

“We’re here,” he said, then started following the thin line that indicated their road with the same finger. Whenever he came to places where the road branched off, he took a moment to make sure he was following the same directions he’d come along on their way in. Eventually, his finger pushed along by a small blue dot with the word station beneath it, written very small.

“This is probably it,” Bear said. “See the other one’s sort of spread out in other places?”

Chris did see it. The map was zoomed out pretty far, showing what he guessed was easily fifty to sixty miles of the Alaskan wilderness all around Maupin Lake. There were four more of those blue dots, indicating the little rescue stations Jay had mentioned.

“How far away do you think that is?” Bobby asked.

“Thirteen miles at least.”

“How far away is Birch?” Noah asked. “Can’t be more than twenty, right?”

“Something like that, I’d guess.”

“So let me get this straight,” Noah said. “We’re talking about walking to that rescue station?”

“That or until one of us can pull up some signal on our phones,” Bear said.

Noah and Bobby both uttered exasperated curses. Chris placed his hands on his hips and looked back at the ruined SUV.

“I’ll be the wimp of the group,” Bobby said. “I have no problem stating that I don’t know if I can make that walk.”

“Well, it’s too risky for any one of us to stay here,” Chris said. He said it quickly, before any insults or retorts could come out instead.

“And why not?” Bobby asked.

“Because if we split up and something happens to the ones that go walking, there’s no way for the other two to know.”

“If you aren’t back with help by tomorrow morning, I’d assume something bad happened,” Bobby said. “It’s not too difficult.”

Chris was storming towards him before he knew he was even moving. He drew his right hand back, but Bear caught him before he could throw the punch. Bobby came surging forward seeing that Chris was restrained, a sneer on his face and fury in his eyes.

“I told these guys you and I needed to fight it out,” Bobby said. “If it’s what you want, let’s go. Let him go, Bear!”

“Bobby…” Noah said, clearly not comfortable with the situation. “Just shut up, man.”

Chris pushed against Bear, but knew he wouldn’t be able to break past the man’s baffling strength. Bear’s arms wrapped around his chest were like tree roots or iron rods. “You miserable bastard,” Chris hissed. “You’d do it, too, wouldn’t you? Let others go out into danger while you sat here in front of a fire, drinking.”

“What can I say?” Bobby said. “I’m used to keeping things warm. You can ask Vicki all about that.”

Chris grunted as he tried to get past Bear, straining so hard that it hurt his head. But in doing so, something totally unexpected happened. Bear pushed Chris back with just enough force that he collided with the side of the SUV. While Chris nearly fell to the ground, Bear lunged at Bobby and shoved him much harder than he’d shoved Chris. It was hard enough to almost be considered a punch to the chest. To Chris’s delight, Bobby’s feet actually left the ground. He flew back about two feet and landed hard on the ground.

“That’s enough of that,” Bear yelled. “You mention it one more time and you won’t have to worry about Chris throwing punches.” Bear took a moment to adjusted the cuffs around his forearms. “Keep it up and I’ll knock your teeth out. Your posturing and strutting are useless out here, so you might as well man up! We’re walking. All four of us. And if you run your mouth like this while we’re out there, I will kick your ass.”

Bobby scrambled to his feet and seemed to think about charging forward. But he changing his mind at the last moment. He nodded and looked to Bear, Noah, and Chris. “So, it’s all of you against me now, is it?”

“I’m not choosing sides,” Noah said, raising his hands in surrender. “This whole thing is ridiculous, if you ask me. Given the situation we’re facing, I couldn’t care less about the drama between the two of you.”

“Exactly,” Bear said. “And we don’t have time to lose. Daylight burns fast around here; in case you haven’t noticed. So, let’s get inside, pack some essentials, and get to walking.”

“This is insane,” Bobby said, nearly hissing the words.

“Maybe it is,” Bear said, already heading for the little porch again. “But right now, it’s the only option we have.”

To that, Bobby had nothing more to say. He gave them all a weary look, leaving the nastiest of them all for Chris. He then lowered his head and stomped inside. Chris remained by the SUV for a moment, trying to swallow down the past few minutes, trying to make sense of what, exactly, was going on. He one hundred percent agreed with Bear; walking to the nearest rescue station was their only hope. He figured there might be a small chance they’d run into more travelers with a ride along the way, cutting some time off of their walk. Maybe it wasn’t as dismal as it seemed.

Yet as he walked back to the cabin, one last thought struck him and it sent a spiral of cold fear straight into his heart. He looked back to the fox and wondered if the same hands that had pried up the hood and slaughtered the fox might be out there, waiting for them.

---

Bear made absolutely no comment when he went into the SUV and took out the rifle and the single box of shells. He didn’t ask if anyone else wanted to carry it or if they were comfortable with him having it. He took the rifle, shoved the ammo down into his backpack, and held the rifle curiously, as if testing the feel of it. It was a smaller rifle, a basic Remington bolt action model with a cheap scope attached. Chris couldn’t deny that he felt slightly safer with the rifle in Bear’s hands. He was the closest thing to an outdoorsman among them. Chris had only shot a gun twice in his life: a small .22 rifle while hunting squirrels with his uncle at thirteen, and a Glock during a friend’s bachelor party after high school as they’d shot up their Senior yearbook.

The four of them started walking without much discussion. They’d taken all of ten minutes to pack and dress appropriately. Perhaps because of the skirmishing between them that morning, there had been no community-style packing. Instead, each person had packed their own supplies, their own food, their own extra clothing. Each person was responsible for their own supplies, and the packing had been done in silence.

To no one’s surprise, Bobby had somehow managed to cram nine cans of beer into his pack, along with snacks and other staples. Chris could not stop the spitefulness inside of him as he wished quite hard that every one of those beer cans would pop or explode in the bag, soaking everything. To Bobby’s credit, he hadn’t started drinking yet—though it was only 9:17 in the morning.

“Thirteen miles,” Noah said as they started moving forward. “I don’t know that I’ve ever hiked that far—much less in this sort of cold weather.”

Chris had only walked such a distance once in his life, during a happier time in Arizona with Vicki, before work and raising a child had presented new challenges. They’d hiked along some of the trails down inside the rim of the Grand Canyon, camped in one of the more secluded public campgrounds and had made love all night. Even if they were currently on good terms, that memory would have still felt like a different world, a different life. Given the predicament he was currently in, Chris thought any memory from his past might seem like it had occurred in another world.

That hike had been more than ten years ago, and he had no idea how he would cope with what was ahead of them. He could only hope against hope that they crossed paths with other travelers, preferably in a vehicle. Or maybe they’d spot a plane in the sky (possibly piloted by Jay) and be able to flag them down. As the trees started to squeeze in around them, those all seemed like futile hopes, but at least it was something.

Chris looked back to the SUV and the cabin one last time, as if making sure he would remember that they were back there. As he did, he noticed the first few flakes of snow starting to fall. He looked into the sky, studied its slate-gray color for a moment, and those hopes diminished significantly.`,

      content: `Bobby opened his first beer at 10:12. Chris knew the exact time because he made a point of looking at his watch. They’d been walking for a little shy of forty-five minutes; he guessed they’d covered about a mile and a half. It was hard to tell with the bumpy terrain and the slight rises and falls in the ground. Chris was also starting to realize just how disorienting the abundance of tall trees all around them could be. He recalled Jay talking about how even locals that didn’t know what they were doing could get lost out here and Chris had no problem believing it.

“Can we talk about the fox?” Noah asked. “Or are we sort of trying to ignore it?”

“We can talk about it,” Bear said. “It was dead. It bled a lot. Anything else you want to know about it?”

“Yeah. For starters, how did it die and how did it get there?”

“That doesn’t bother me as much as how someone popped the hood like that,” Chris pointed out. “It was either an expert car thief or a very strong man. And I don’t think an expert car thief would have come all the way out to the cabin just to mess with our heads like that.”

“So, more locals?” Bobby asked. His tone indicated that he didn’t really believe it at all.

“If they were locals, then I think we’re smart to be getting the hell out of here early,” Noah said. “I mean…the deer on the porch was one thing. But that fox had been ripped in half.”

The conversation stopped there, having thoroughly creeped them out. They carried on, walking in zig-zagged single file line. Chris made sure that he had at least one person between him and Bobby at all times. His anger towards Bobby and Vicki had faded, overshadowed by the strange situation they now found themselves in. It was one thing to isolate yourself willingly in the Alaskan wilderness with friends for some fun, drinking, and fishing. It was quite another to be walking through that same wilderness after having woodland creatures gutted on your doorstep and your one vehicle rendered useless. He was frightened but also a little uncertain because he had no real idea just how frightened he should be.

The snow was still falling and though it was really nothing more than flurries, the cold, unforgiving ground seemed to gather the flakes up with remarkable speed. It somehow made the forest feel thicker, and every sound they made—just their voices and footfalls so far—seemed to fall dead right away. No echo, no carrying of sound…nothing.

But as far as Chris was concerned, this was a good thing. It meant that if there were others out and about—be it in trucks, Jeeps, or ATVs or—they’d have no problem hearing them. Though, all Chris had heard were the creaking of branches and something very close to a groan coming from the forest as the smaller trees leaned slightly in the barely there breeze.

Having not eaten anything yet, Chris stopped for a moment and unzipped his pack. He pulled out a bottled water and a granola bar. As he started to unwrap the bar, something sounded out in the woods to the left. It was eerily familiar—almost exactly the same thing he and Bear had heard last night while sitting out at the fire pit…like a man clearing his throat, only somehow more primal. It was distant, but still loud enough to grab their attention.

All four of them turned in that direction. All Chris could see was a sea of trees, winter-stripped and slowly gathering the snow that fell from the sky. The sight went on and on, and from what he could tell, there was no break in it. If there was something out there moving among it all, it was doing an excellent job of staying hidden.

The sound came again, smaller this time. But this time, it was accompanied by what sounded like a series of heavy footsteps, three in all, and the slight sound of foliage shifting. And though Chris knew he couldn’t actually hear such a thing, he could nearly imagine something breathing out there—something looking towards them in the same way they were looking out into the trees.

“Wolves?” Noah asked.

“Don’t know,” Bear answered. Chris noticed that Bear was gripping the rifle a little tighter now. “Whatever it is, it seems to be as uncertain of us as we are of it, though. If it is a wolf, it’s not a very brave one.”

“What if it’s a bear?” Noah asked.

“Then we’re lunch,” Bobby said, snickering nervously. When he saw Bear and Chris looking at him with disdain, Bobby shrugged. “What? Look, man. I’m no gun expert by any means, but if a bear comes charging out of those woods at us, you think a few blasts from that little rifle is going to stop it?”

It was a good point. This once again reminded Chris of the little .22 rifle he used to hunt squirrels with. This one didn’t look much tougher. It might be suitable to hunt deer with, and if they did have a problem with wolves, it might take one out if the shot landed correctly. But a bear…well, that was going to be a completely different story.

They remained still for a few moments longer before Bear started walking forward again. “Whatever it is, we can’t keep stopping every time we hear something out there. This walk is going to be long enough as it is.”

“Thanks for the reminder,” Bobby said. He chugged the rest of his beer down and tossed the empty out into the edge of the woods.

“Seriously?” Chris said. “Littering?”

Bobby shrugged and dug another beer out of his pack. “If you don’t like it, call the cops or the highway patrol or something.”

Chris took a deep breath and shoved his hands into his pockets to prevent himself from instinctively making fists. He put the empty granola bar wrapper into his bag and took another sip of water. He got to his feet, re-situated his pack on his back, and made sure Noah remained between him and Bobby as they started walking again.

He didn’t hear the noise out in the woods again, but he kept looking out that way. Everything looked the same, a copy of a copy with every few steps. The only thing was that was different, though, was the gentle, growing layer of freshly fallen snow.`,

      content: `“You guys ever see Predator?” Noah asked.

They’d been walking in mostly silence for about another half an hour. There had been no further noises from the forest or arguments among their group. The little conversation that passed between them was scant and meaningless. It was mostly complaints from Bobby about how cold it was and how this trip had really not lived up to his expectations. Other than that, it had been quiet. Chris wasn’t sure if it was because of the tension still boiling among them or if everyone was trying to keep their ears open to hear anything that might move around out in the sea of trees.

“With the alien and Schwarzenegger, right?” Bobby asked.

“Yeah,” Noah said. “In that movie, the alien was up in the trees most of the time. And even though it was quiet, some soldiers could still sort of hear it and see it. You remember that?”

Bear turned to him and gave him a frown. “Are you suggesting that a bloodthirsty warrior alien killed the deer and fox at the cabin, tore up out only way out of here, and is currently following us through the woods?”

“No. I just think…hell, I don’t know. I sort of feel like there’s something out there. Watching us. Seriously…am I the only one?”

“No,” Chris said, not realizing he was going to say anything until it was out of his mouth. “No, I felt it, too. Not so much right now, but definitely back when we heard something moving out in the woods.”

“How long ago was that?” Bobby asked. “Forty-five minutes? An hour?”

“Closer to half an hour,” Bear said.

“How far do you think we’ve walked?”

Bear took a moment to think about it and shrugged. “If I was feeling gracious, which I’m not, I’d say maybe five miles. But it’s probably closer to four.”

Chris checked his watch and saw that it was only 11:39. He thought it would be later. Maybe that was because the snow had started to really gather on the ground now, making him think time had progressed faster than it really had. The flurries had picked up a bit, but it was still nothing he’d consider heavy. They’d been on the same trail the entire time, though Chris could see a spot just up ahead where the path forked to the right while also staying ahead.

“We take that right up ahead, yeah?” Chris asked.

“Yes,” Bear said. “And then about three miles down that, another right.”

“Four friggin’ miles,” Bobby said. “We’ll never get to that station at this rate. You know, it’s not too late to turn around and go back to the cabin. Maybe if we don’t turn up with the SUV in a few days, the rental place will send someone to come out looking for us.”

“I legitimately thought about that, too,” Bear said. “But there was a deer, then a fox, and a ruined battery in the car. Someone does not want us at that cabin and with just one gun between us, I think we’re better to report it as soon as possible. If we stay there another night, there’s no telling what might come next.”

“And let’s not forget about those stories Jay told us,” Noah said. He said it with a bit of jest, but there was also a very serious undertone to his voice.

At the mention of Jay, Chris found himself automatically looking up into the sky. But all there was to see was a rolling sort of grey and countless snowflakes descending.

“Let’s not go there,” Bear said. “Being visitors, the chances of us getting lost are pretty decent—especially with this damned snow coming down. I don’t want to hear spooky stories about how even the locals get disoriented. And if one of you even suggests that what we’re hearing out there are Yupik spirits, I’ll punch you in the face.”

“Um, excuse me, sir,” Bobby said, “but I believe punching people is Chris’s department.”

“Shut up, Bobby,” Chris spat.

“Or what?” Bobby threatened.

“Good comeback. Maybe let’s settle it with some kickball and a snack of carrot sticks and chocolate milk. You sound like a third grader right now, you know that?”

“According to your wi—”

“Bobby,” Bear snapped, his voice loud and authoritative. “I want you to remember what I said at the cabin, right before we left. If either of you—you or Chris, I don’t care which—get into this, I’ll knock you out myself. Either of you. You have my word on that. Shut your mouth. That is your absolute last warning, so help me God.”

Bear was facing Bobby now, and though Chris did not get the full bore of Bear’s gaze, he could see the rage lurking behind it. Chris had no doubt that Bear would be true to his word. He also knew that, as Chris’s best friend, there was some defensiveness towards Chris in his threats. But Chris also knew that even if they were best friends, Bear would indeed punch him out if he tried to start trouble.

Bear turned back around and started walking. He did not make sure the other three were following him—he just walked. Of course, the rest fell in behind rather quickly; Chris went first, then Noah, then Bobby. As he did so, Bobby made a big show of chugging from his beer.

Any semblance of normalcy seemed to have dissolved among them after Bear’s last eruption. No one spoke. They simply soldiered on like scolded children; heads lowered against the escalating snow. It was now covering most of the ground and making a soft crunching noise under their feet. Chris didn’t check the time on his watch and he didn’t look up often. He simply followed Bear; when Bear made the right at the fork, they all did the same. When Bear stopped to take a leak and grab a snack, the rest followed suit.

Chris finally allowed himself to check his watch when his knees started to really protest the hike. He was astonished to see that it had somehow come to be 2:05. He wanted to ask Bear how far he thought they’d come, but he didn’t want to sound like Bobby. He had noticed that their pace had slowed a bit. And though the snowfall petered out, back to little more than flurries now, the additional inch or so was making it harder to walk.

“I need to take a leak,” Chris said. This was a lie. He wanted a break but didn’t want to admit it. When he said it, he thought he saw visible signs of relief from the other three.

“Thank the Lord above,” Bobby said. “I need to stop walking. I’m starting to get dizzy.”

“How many beers have you had so far?” Noah asked.

“Only four, smart ass. You want one?”

Noah started to shake his head, but then shrugged. “You know what? Yeah, I think I will have one. Might make this nightmare a little more enjoyable.”

As Chris walked into the woods a bit and undid his fly, he could hear Bobby and Noah popping the tabs on their cans. He managed to squeeze a bit of urine out and then went back to the path. He was relieved to see that Bear and Noah were both sitting on a fallen log just a bit off the path. Bobby was a few feet farther back, turned away from them and taking a leak of his own.

Bear looked at them with something very much like sorrow. “It’s too late to do much now, but I apologize if I pushed us into making the wrong choice. Based on the time we’re making; I don’t see how we’ll make it to that station by nightfall. And even if we do…I don’t know how it’s all run. I mean, there’s no guarantee anyone would even be there when we arrive.”

“Any idea how far we’ve come?” Chris asked.

“No. I left my Apple watch at home…with all the mile trackers and everything.”

Noah chuckled. “I had one of those running apps on my phone until two months ago. Got tired of running and never used it, so I deleted it. Could have used that to tell us how far we’ve come.”

“Well, I’ll be damned,” Bobby said, looking at his watch as he walked over to join them. “I didn’t even think about it.” He looked to his watch, pulled up the activity tracker and cursed. “Well, that can’t be right.”

“What?” Noah asked.

“It says one and a quarter mile.”

“Yeah, no, we’ve definitely walked farther than that,” Bear said. “Has it always worked?”

“As far as I know.” For the first time since waking up that morning, Bobby showed true signs of fear. He kept tapping something on his watch and then shaking his head.

Chris slipped his pack from his shoulders, grabbed his phone from the front pocket, and checked it. When he saw the X where the signal indicator was, he wasn’t surprised. No harm in checking, I guess, he thought. It seemed technology was going to continue to fail them.

“If I had to make a guess,” Bear said, “I’d say we’ve covered about eight miles. It’s so hard to even guess in this weather and on these roads. But I know it’s been far more than a mile and a quarter.”

“The average person, with no athletic ability, is supposed to be able to walk a mile in about twenty minutes or so,” Noah said. “Throw in this snow and the terrain. I’d say it’s probably closer to twenty-five for us. And we’ve been walking for what…a little less than five hours? So yeah…I’d say eight miles. Nine at most.”

“I mean, if we really pick up the pace…” Chris said, but then hesitated. “I don’t know. Maybe we can make it just after nightfall. And if we get to the station and no one is there, maybe we’re still going to be okay. There has to be something, right? Some sort of phone or emergency vehicle?”

“Maybe,” Bear said. “But even then, we—”

A sound from the forest interrupted him. At first, Chris thought it was Bobby trying to play a prank or be stupid, but Bobby was still tapping uselessly at his watch. He looked just as shocked as everyone else when he turned back towards the woods, looking out into the trees.

Chris knew what the sound had been, but it made no sense. It also sent a dagger of worry into his heart.

It had been a person, screaming. And though the voice had been weak and haggard, Chris was pretty sure he’d heard the word “Help!”

Someone was out there, shouting for help. From the tone of the single shout he’d heard, it sounded female.

“That was a woman, right?” Chris said.

“Sounded like it,” Bear confirmed. “Sounded hurt.”

“From that way, right?” Bobby asked, pointing to the right and slightly behind them. He seemed to be using his beer can as some sort of odd transmission device.

The sound came again, this time more urgent and forming more words. And though it was still very distant, Chris could feel the pain in it.

There was a muffled shout, followed by: “Please…someone help me!”

Chris could feel the energy between the four of them shift at the plea for help. Their own fear and distress developed into something else. And because Bear had more or less been leading their charge so far, the direction of that energy seemed to be coming from him. Because Chris knew the man so well, he could already see what was about to happen: Bear was going to go into the woods to locate the woman, no questions asked.

Already, he was walking off of the path, into the trees. There was no discussion, no back and forth at all. He just went.

“Wait, hold on,” Bobby said. “You’re just going to go off into the woods?”

“Someone is hurting or stranded out there,” Bear said. “And we’re here, perfectly fine and capable. So yes, we’re going.”

“We?”

“Or not,” Bear said. “If you’d rather sit here on the road by yourself and guzzle beer, be my guest. But I don’t know when we’ll be back.”

“You have no clue what’s wrong with her!” Bobby said.

“Exactly! It could be very minor or it could be serious. I’m not going to—”

The woman’s voice came sailing out of the woods again: “Pleeease…” After this, there was a strained sort of crying noise and another “Please, help! Help me!!!”

“To hell with this,” Chris said. He stormed past Bobby, purposefully shoulder-checking him. Bobby stumbled a bit but did not fall. “Either come or don’t. But we’re not going to listen to you gripe about going to help someone in need.”

“Fine! Go play hero. Noah and I will stay here and—”

“No, Bobby,” Noah said. “I’m going. She needs help.”

“You don’t even know who it is!”

“Does it matter?” Chris said. And then, unable to help himself, he added: “Maybe she’s married. Would that help? Would you go running to her, then?”

“Both of you need to grow up,” Bear hissed.

Bear continued walking further out into the woods, his feet crunching the snow beneath his feet. Chris followed, and Noah trailed behind him. Chris didn’t turn to see if Bobby changed his mind and decided to follow. But seconds later, he heard a fourth set of feet reluctantly stepping off the path and into the forest. He was muttering under his breath and calling them every name in the book, but Bobby was coming.

And further ahead, the woman screamed again.`,

      content: `They had been off of the sorry excuse for a road for about three minutes when Bear started yelling back at the woman. When he did, he didn’t ask anyone else’s opinion or give them a heads up that he was going to do it. He simply bellowed out into the forest, giving Chris a pretty good scare.

“We’re coming to help,” Bear hollered. “Can you hear me?”

Once Chris collected his wits and calmed his heart rate a bit, he could listen accurately. When he heard the woman respond, he thought this might turn out okay—that they might be able to reach the woman quickly and without much trouble.

“Yes! I’m here! Thank God! Please…quick!” Her voice was shrill and desperate.

“Still sounds like she’s a pretty good distance off, right?” Noah asked.

“Yeah, a bit,” Bear said. “She could have fallen down a small hill or rock-face or something. She might be in a bottom or gulley.”

“Or up a tree like the Predator, right Noah?” Bobby asked.

Noah showed Bobby his middle finger. If he’d been trying to stay in the middle of the road concerning the drama with Bobby, it was clear that Noah was now much more on the side of Chris and Bear. Whether or not Bobby had noticed this was beyond Chris’s comprehension.

The woman’s voice grew louder as they drew closer. There was still a strange sort of muffled quality to it, making Chris think that perhaps Bear had been right; maybe she had fallen into a ravine or some sort of hole. Every now and then, even when she wasn’t calling out to them, they could hear muddled gasps and sobs.

Of course, Chris also thought of the fox and the deer. He wondered if this woman had come very close to meeting the same fate as those unfortunate animals.

They kept walking, guided by the woman’s voice and noises. As they drew closer to her, the pained sounds she was making became creepier. Chris got the feeling that they were not walking towards a human, but some sort of a clever beast that was luring them in with a bit of mimicry.

Chris glanced back towards the road, but it was long gone. The dizzying array of trees had swallowed it up, their stripped branches woven together like a strange tapestry. The snow was only making it worse and he got the fearful feeling that if they ventured much deeper into these woods, they might be in serious trouble. Jay’s warnings kept flashing in his mind, reminding him that even locals could get lost and stranded out in these woods.

As if reading his mind, Noah spoke up. He sounded genuinely worried, but it was clear that he was doing everything he could to keep a cool exterior. “If we get lost out here,” he said, “I say we kill Bear first and eat him.”

“Pork chops,” Bobby said with a snicker. He had opened another beer. Chris wasn’t sure how many this was. Four? Five? Honestly, he didn’t give a damn.

“Yeah?” Bear said under his breath. “That’s fine, but I hope you all choke on me.”

Before anyone could make any further smartass comments, the woman called out again. This time, it was apparent that she was very close.

“Are you still there?” she called out.

Bear, still in the lead, stopped and looked immediately to the left. “We’re here! And it seems we’re close.”

“Thank you! Thank you…” But then she was crying again.

Bear started to the left and made only several steps through the thin sheet of snow before he stopped again. Chris didn’t see why at first, but then, after a few steps of his own, was forced to stop, too.

There was a rather steep shift to the ground, a severe drop that was nearly vertical at first but then slowly started to even out. When it did, the ground gave way to small outcroppings of rock and exposed tree roots. Beyond that, about twelve feet below them, was a creek bed. The little water that was still there was frozen solid.

Sitting on the side of the bank opposite them was a frightened woman. She looked to be in her early twenties. She dressed very warmly—the bulkiness under her snow bibs indicated that she had at least two layers on under it—but she still looked very pale. Her brown hair was mostly tucked up into a stocking cap, which was also covered by the hood from her parka. Her brown eyes were wide with pain and fear. She wasn’t blue yet, but another few hours out here would likely get it done.

“Thank the Lord,” the woman said, near tears. “I thought I was going to die. I thought I…”

“How badly are you hurt?” Chris asked. He was amazed at how smooth and calm he sounded. He was slipping into the role of the caring doctor without even realizing it. Bear, who was essentially serving as the leader of the group, gladly took a step back as Chris took over.

“I’m…I’m pretty sure my right leg is broken. I can’t put pressure on it. I tried dragging myself out and kept slipping and falling. I just…I gave up and didn’t know what else to do.”

“Any idea how long you’ve been here?”

She shook her head, but her eyes went slack, as if she was mulling the question over. “Not sure. I think this is the second day. One night, for sure.”

“Jesus,” Noah muttered.

“Okay, give us a second and we’ll figure out a way to get you out of there,” Bear said. He then turned to the other three. The look of determination on his face let them know that this was not going to be a discussion. He was going to tell them what to do, and that was just how it was going to be. Chris was rather glad for the authority. In a situation like this, there was just no room for indecisiveness.

“It won’t take all four of us,” Bear said, already reclaiming the leadership position back from Chris. “But I think at least three of us need to get down there. I can get her up on my shoulders, firefighter style. But I need someone to sort of brace her, walking by me in case she slips. And someone else needs to be behind me in case I fall. Whoever stays up here can help me up once I get back up to this straight drop.”

“And we’re going to have to keep in mind,” Chris said, “that if her leg is broken, there’s not much we can do to get her out of there that’s not going to hurt her. We have to be ready for that. It could get ugly.”

All three of the others nodded, but no one moved right away. Bobby raised his hand, not trying to be funny but out of a strange sort of respect for the situation. “I’ll stay up here.” There was a brief moment where Chris thought he saw something like regret on Bobby’s face when he said: “Five beers in, taking a walk down that bank would be a death sentence.”

Convenient, Chris thought. But it was actually some pretty cautious thinking on Bobby’s part. At least he seemed to be a team player for the moment.

Wanting to stop himself before he said anything, Chris started for the embankment. Standing on the snow-covered edge of it was a bit chilling. The sheer drop was only about four or five feet, but it was just that—a straight drop. One wrong move and he’d be down on those unearthed chunks of rock just as busted up as this woman.

He knelt down on the ground and turned to face Bear. With his back to the creek bed and his feet angled over into open space, he slowly started to slide down the vertical drop. He dug the toes of his boots into the ground, searching for one of the exposed roots for a foothold. He found one but it didn’t do much for support. With his hands gripping the edge, he descended the steep embankment and reached safer terrain where the ground had leveled out. From there, it was simply a matter of using careful footing on the rocks. The snow had made them slippery, and their smooth surfaced made them hazardous.

Chris managed to make it down to the hard sand of the creek bed without falling. As soon as he was done, Bear came down just as easily. Noah took a bit longer, nearly losing his grip as he scaled down the vertical drop, but he also made it safely.

Bear turned his attention immediately to the woman. “What’s your name?”

“Kelly,” she stuttered. The frigid temperature caused her teeth to clack together. This close to her, Chris could see something more than fear in her eyes. He could not quite place it, though; it seemed primal, almost unhinged.

“Kelly, is there anything hurting other than your leg?” Chris asked.

“My elbow. I can move it, though. And…I’m freezing. I haven’t felt my left foot in a while.”

“Okay,” Chris said. “We’re going to attempt to move you.”

“I don’t know…I really messed my leg up.”

“I think I can get you up to the top,” Bear said. “But I’ll need to put you on my back, so there shouldn’t be any pressure on your leg.”

“I imagine it’s going to cause your leg to hurt like hell, though,” Chris said.

“It’s okay.” Her voice was soft, tired, and nearly raw. “I doubt I’d feel it much anyway. But yes, please…get me out of here.”

“You mentioned not being able to feel your left foot,” Chris said. “Can you wiggle your toes?”

Kelly did, experimentally. Chris could see slight movement within her boots, barely moving the tops of them. Kelly nodded and looked up at him. “You a doctor or something?”

“Pediatrician. Now, when you wiggled them, could you feel them moving? Could you feel the surrounding shoe, the socks?”

“Yes.”

“That’s a good sign, at least.”

As they crossed the frozen creek, Chris looked to the side of the embankment she’d come down. It wasn’t quite as steep as the one they’d just traversed, but it still looked treacherous. “You mind if we ask what happened?”

“I was camping with Jason…my fiancé. Out on the rim of Maupin Lake. We woke up one morning and something attacked us right away. A bear, maybe…I don’t know…” She started to cry as the told the story and Chris was suddenly sorry he’d asked. “It landed right on Jason while we were trying to run away. I heard it. Wet, tearing…and Jason was screaming and then…then he wasn’t. The last thing I heard out of him was him telling me to run. So that’s what I did. I ran and ran and got lost. Then I fell in this…and…and…”

She started to breathe heavily. The large, hitching breaths sounded painful and strained coming out of her. Chris could tell there was a something damming up her emotions and when it broke, she might very well become catatonic with it.

“It’s okay,” Bear said, hunkering down next to her. He placed a reassuring hand on Kelly’s shoulder and said, “I’m ready to give this a try when you are. Just say the word.”

“Yes, please…”

Bear shared an uneasy glance with Chris. Chris then looked to Kelly’s right leg. If it was broken, it was not apparent in the positioning of her leg. He hoped that might be a good sign and would make the movement a little less painful. He helped Bear shift her into a more rigid sitting position. Kelly leaned against Bear for a moment, moaning.

“Okay, here we go,” Bear said. “If it gets to be too much, just tell me.”

Before she could say anything, Bear hitched his arm under Kelly’s right armpit and lifted her up. At first, it seemed as if the motion wasn’t hurting her too badly. But when Bear shifted his weight and turned to place her on his shoulders in a fireman’s carry, she screamed. Chris saw her right leg dangling and now realized how broken it was. It was snapped slightly backward and to the right. As they perched her full weight on Bear’s shoulders, the leg bounced lifelessly. Kelly shrieked, but then did her best to hold it back. Chris thought of reaching out to stabilize it, but that might only cause more pain.

Bear took a step forward towards the embankment, making sure to keep a careful step on the rock outcroppings. With that single motion, Kelly screamed again. She writhed a bit, and her brown hair spilled out of the thick hood of the parka she was wearing under the snow bibs. The scream she let out was a raspy one that came for deep inside of her. It ended with a choked little whimper and then, to Chris’s surprise, Kelly’s body went limp.

“I think she passed out,” Noah noted, standing directly beside Bear to act as a weight assist if Bear should need it.

“Good,” Chris said. “That might make this easier. But if those bone shards scrape together, she’ll probably wake back up pretty damned quick.”

Bear made his way up the rock outcroppings and, with his head lowered and shoulders hunches, reached up for one of the larger roots that were poking out of the soil along the embankment. He gripped it, tested its hold, and then started up. He made it just two hard-earned steps up before he lost his footing. He slipped backwards a foot or so and, in adjusting his weight to try to keep Kelly from falling, pitched himself to the left. He collided with Noah, sending him onto his rear end back down on the sandy embankment.

Chris acted quickly, grabbing Bear’s massive arm. It was like grabbing a rock because his muscles were flexed so tightly in making sure Kelly stayed hoisted in the fireman’s carry. Bear had at least seventy pounds on Chris, so keeping him upright was no simple task. Chris’s own feet slipped and fought for traction on the last of the rocks. For a moment, he was sure the three of them would go down in a heap, Bear landing on Kelly’s broken leg.

Somehow, he managed to keep them upright, though he figured it had more to do with Bear’s agility than with his own strength. Through it all, Kelly remained knocked out. Bear took a moment to reposition himself and tried again. This time, he made it a bit higher up, but still could not manage to make any real forward momentum up the incline with the added weight on his shoulders. He slowly came back down to the creek bed, clearly frustrated.

“What if we carry her sort of like a piece of furniture?” Noah suggested. “Someone get her arms and someone get her good leg.”

“Wouldn’t work,” Chris pointed out. “At some point, her head or back or busted leg would hit the ground.”

“And pulling her up that incline, even with someone helping to push from the other end, is going to be even harder than having her on my shoulders like this,” Bear said.

“Well, hold on,” Bobby said from the ground above. “I’ll run down along this bank and see if the drop gets smaller. Then you guys can just hike down the creek bed and get her out somewhere else.”

It was a good idea, but it irritated Chris that Bobby had come up with it. He watched as Bobby took off to the right—the direction Chris thought they had originally been headed. A little trickle of fear dripped down into his mind when he realized that he was becoming very disoriented. He suddenly had no idea which way they needed to go in order to get back on the road.

With Bobby gone, Bear slowly dropped to his knees. Chris and Noah helped slip Kelly off of his shoulders. Chris rested her back against his chest, not wanting her to lie down on the cold sand of the bank.

“What do we do if we can’t get her out of here?” Noah asked.

“Well, I figure the worst-case scenario is to stick with our plan,” Bear said. “We were heading for a rescue station for assistance in getting out of here. Whoever is there to help us could get in touch with someone that can rescue her, too.”

“She’s in rough shape, man,” Chris said. “At least one of us would have to stay here with her.”

“Yeah, probably. Which is why I hope we can find a way to get her out of this.”

“I’ll head down and look that way,” Noah said, nodding to the left. He did so right away; he didn’t climb the bank, but stayed on the creek bed.

“This is messed up,” Chris said.

“It is,” Bear agreed. “It’s certainly not the sort of adventure I had planned on.” Before he’d placed Kelly on his shoulders, he’d set the rifle down, propping it up against one outcropping of rocks. He looked to it almost longingly in the silence that followed.

“Level with me,” Chris said. “It just the two of us. Given what she told us about something chasing them…how it took her fiancé…do you really think the deer and the fox were the work of locals just screwing with us?”

“No,” Bear said right away. A look of regret crossed his face, making it clear he wished he had not spoken so quickly. “I mean, it’s the sensible answer, right? But both of those animals were butchered. Not shot, not professionally gutted with a knife. They’d been torn open—like someone might tear open an orange, you know?”

“So…what are you thinking?”

“No idea. Maybe it is locals, and they just happened to come across those carcasses. Maybe something else killed them out int eh forests and locals picked them up as props.”

“But if something else killed them—say a wolf or a bear—wouldn’t they have taken the bodies somewhere secure to eat?”

“I don’t know,” Bear said, and left it at that.

Three minutes passed. Kelly moaned a bit here and there, and Chris could see that she was getting paler. From the left, they could hear footsteps as Noah started heading back.

“Chris, I think you should be the one to stay,” Bear said. “If we have to leave her here, I think you need to be the one to stay with her. You and Bobby need to separate, and I would absolutely, in no way, ever consider leaving Bobby to care for someone in this woman’s situation. And I mean, you’re a doctor after all. Of course, if you disagree, we can talk it out, but—”

“No, that makes sense.” He hated the idea of being stranded in this shallow ravine, alone with an injured woman and in the cold. But it did make sense, and there was no way in hell they were leaving her behind to fend for herself.

Noah appeared around a slight bend in the ravine, shaking his head when he saw them. “About fifty yards over that way, there’s a wall of deadfall and just a tangled mess. And between here and there, the bank doesn’t get any easier.”

Although Bobby had not yet come back, Chris somehow knew that he was going to bring similar news. It was an odd feeling—like hearing the telephone ring and somehow knowing without a doubt that there was bad news on the other end. And when he heard Bobby’s footsteps crunching through the thin sheet of snow-covered foliage five minutes later, he’d already accepted what the next day or so of his life was going to look like.`,

      content: `Chris’s gut feeling had been one hundred percent accurate. When Bobby reappeared above them, looking down from higher ground, his face said everything before he spoke a word. “No dice,” he said. “There are a few places that are even worse than this—rockier and steeper. I only walked for what…ten minutes before I came back? But I mean, unless we want to sort of haul her along down there hoping for things to get better, I don’t see a solution.”

“You think we could do that?” Noah asked.

“Do what?” Bear replied.

“Walk along down here and just hope the banks improve.”

“We’d lose our way,” Chris said. “If it starts to bend even the slightest bit away from the road, we’re screwed. But it’s okay. You guys go, and I’ll stay here with her.”

“Ah, hell,” Noah said. “That seems sort of drastic.”

“It is drastic,” Chris said. “But I don’t see any other choice.”

Bear sighed and looked up at the sky. The snow had stopped falling a while ago, but the sky remained fat with the promise of more.

“You sure about this?” Bear asked.

“Not at all. But go anyway.”

“No cellphones, no walkies, nothing,” Bear said. “We have no way at all to stay in touch with you. If we leave you here, you won’t hear from us again until we come back with someone. And God only knows how long that will be.”

“Speaking of cellphones,” Bobby said from above them. “I pulled mine out on the way back, checking to see if my activity tracker had worked out its kinks. Now it’s reading three hundred and seven miles.”

“Yeah, I’d say that thing is shot,” Noah said.

“We can talk about the many ways electronics are the devil’s business when this is over,” Chris barked. “For now, get back to the road and haul ass. I trust you guys can do it. We’re wasting time right now and you almost certainly won’t get there before nightfall now. I’d really rather not be here too long after it gets dark. It’s going to get damned cold and it…”

“I know,” Bear said. He looked to the rifle, still propped against the rocks. “I’m leaving that with you. I don’t know much about the predatory habits of animals, but I know you have a wounded person with you and you’re more or less stranded. So keep it with you. I also figure with these woods being so quiet, we’ll hear it if you fire it and we’ll know to come running back.”

That said, Bear reached into his pack and pulled out the small box of shells. Chris took them uncertainly. “If I have to fire it,” Chris said, “I doubt you’d make it back in time to do anything.”

“That’s very cheerful.”

“He’s right, though,” Bobby said from above. “We’re wasting time. If we’re going, let’s get moving. Daylight’s wasting.”

Slowly, Noah started making his way up the rocks and scrambling up the bank. He almost fell twice, only managing to save himself by grabbing tree roots both times. Bear looked back down at Chris, who was already shifting a bit to rest his back against the area where the rough bank met the hard sand of the creek bed.

“I don’t like this one bit,” Bear said.

“I’m not a huge fan of it either. So, get moving. Let me savor the bravery and feel like a hero for at least five minutes. And don’t forget I’m here, okay?”

“You got it,” Bear said, finally starting to make his ascent up the bank. Like Noah, he had some difficulty when he reached the more vertical part. Watching him struggle to get back up, Chris became more aware that there was no way they would ever have managed to get Kelly up there. When Bear finally stood tall on the forest floor, all three of them looked back down at Chris. There was far too much pity in their eyes for Chris’s liking.

“Go already,” Chris boasted. “I’ll be fine.”

Bobby seemed to have no issue with moving on. He was the first to start walking back towards the direction they’d come from. He disappeared after a few moments. Noah was next, giving a sad little wave to Chris as he turned away. When Bear followed, it was clear that it took a great deal of effort. He said nothing…just gave a nod of acknowledgement and appreciation. And just like that, his three friends (well, his two friends and Bobby) were gone.

All that was left to see were the towering trees and a sky that was starting to look heavier and heavier by the second.`,

      content: `The reality of what he was doing set in less than ten minutes after the other three had left. Chris sat with his back up against the bank and a still-passed out Kelly resting with her back against his chest. She smelled like sweat, but he could also catch small notes of some sort of citrus shampoo. A broken leg and a dead fiancé somewhere out in the woods…she’d been through the ringer, that was for sure. Chris had to remind himself of that when he felt the first real stirrings of worry.

Oddly enough, the strange woman pressed against his chest made him think of his daughter. Whenever he read Brianna a story, she always sat like this. She’d sit in his lap, her back against his chest and her head angled slightly so that it rested on his left shoulder. While Kelly was obviously not in his lap, the rest was very much the same. It made him miss Brianna with an intensity that, for a moment, rivaled the uncertainty of staying with Kelly while the others headed back to the road.

Slowly, trying not to stir Kelly any more than he had to, Chris slipped his pack from his shoulder and set it at his side. He unzipped it and made a quick inventory of everything he had with him. There were three bottles of water, two more granola bars, a pack of peanut butter crackers, two gel-pack hand warmers, an extra coat, and an extra pair of gloves. It seemed meager at first, but he kept reminding himself that even if Bear, Noah, and Bobby were very slow in getting back to town, he was likely not going to be out here for any more than ten hours—twelve at most, and that was stretching it. Besides…he knew Bear would kick things into a higher gear now that there was someone else in danger.

Also, if there was any unexpected trouble, he had the rifle. Chris looked at it, still propped against the rocks, and truly hoped he wouldn’t need it. While he was perfectly capable of scaring off a fox with it, he reminded himself that there was something out there that was butchering foxes and deer. Even if it had just been locals messing with them, they were apparently some pretty deranged folks.

He figured his biggest threat for now was the cold. But even that wasn’t as bad as it seemed at first. Being down in the little ravine, most of the chill remained above his head. He did figure that if the wind started to whip up and somehow started billowing through this ragged crack in the ground; he was really going to feel it.

For now, though, he was moderately comfortable. And from what he could tell, Kelly had dressed quite warmly, too. Still, he could not see her face from this vantage point, he could recall the lack of color in her face when they’d first come down to the creek bed. He wondered just how bad off she was and if there was anything at all he could do to help her.

Chris remained alone with nothing more than those rampaging thoughts for the better part of twenty minutes. After that time, Kelly started to twitch and moan. She gave just a few sounds, desperate little whines crawling out of her throat, and then gave a sudden jerk. She whimpered and then seemed to realize that she was leaning against someone.

“Who…?” she asked, then hissed, apparently from the pain.

“My name is Chris. I’m one of the men that found you a bit ago. Do you remember that?”

She nodded. “Your friend put me up on his shoulders. My leg screamed in pain and I blacked out.”

“You okay now?”

“I think so. My leg is just…God…” Her brow scrunched up in pain. “It hurts. And I’m cold.”

“Here,” Chris said, taking the little heated gel pack out of his bag. “I don’t know how much it will help, but I guess it’s better than nothing.” He bent the packaging, snapping the gel inside and activating whatever chemical reaction caused the gel to heat up. He reached in front of him and placed it into Kelly’s gloved hands.

“Thanks,” she said. He could feel her shivering even through her layers of clothes, as well as his own.

“Sure. Now, I know it won’t be especially comfortable, but let me know when I can move you. I don’t think I’m going to be much help if I’m pinned under you.”

“May as well do it now. The pain is so bad the damned thing is almost numb.”

“Okay. I’m just going to sort of slide out and keep you held up by placing my hands on your back. Then I’ll hook you under the elbows and pull you back towards the bank. I’ll do my best not to move your leg any more than I have to.”

“It’s fine,” Kelly said, though he could already hear her wincing in expectation. “Just do it.”

He did, and when he moved, he did it quickly. He slid his rear end along the rough ground, keeping his arms up so she would not fall over. As soon as he was free, he got to his knees and hooked her under the arms, as he’d told her. He then dragged her the foot or so over to the edge of the bank where her back could rest against the rising ground. Kelly bit back a cry when he moved her, but that was the worst of it.

“I wish I at least had some aspirin or something,” Chris said. “I have some water and some food, though. That’s the best I can do. Seems I’m not a very good doctor.”

“Water. Please…”

He uncapped one of the waters and handed it to her. She sipped some of it down at first, but then chugged a few mouthfuls. When she had it down, she focused on screwing the cap back on. She looked at him uncertainly for a moment, as if she wasn’t quite sure if she should trust him.

“So where did your friends go?” she asked.

“We were on our way to one of the rescue stations when we heard you. We were on the road, maybe a little less than halfway there. I’m not sure, really. Walking through this forest, you sort of lose all sense of distance.”

“You were walking?”

“Yeah. We sort of had some car trouble.”

“Oh.” He could tell that she sensed there was more story to be told, but decided not to go after it. Instead, she asked: “Any idea how much farther to that station?”

“About six or seven miles. I think it might be closer to eight. I figure even if it takes them six hours to get there, we should have someone here within seven. You think you can hang in there for that much longer?”

“I’ve made it almost two days,” she said. “What’s another seven hours?” She then looked over to the rifle propped up on the rocks. “You know, I don’t think that’s going to be much help.”

“It’s a just in-case measure,” Chris said, getting to his feet. He looked up and down the ravine and felt utterly alone and trapped.

“Still…if the thing that attacked us comes, you’d be best to use that rifle on yourself.”

“You said it was a bear, right?”

“No. I said I thought it was a bear at first. But I honestly didn’t get a good look at it. It was almost like a human, the way it moved. Big like a bear but…I don’t know. It wasn’t a bear.”

Chris nodded, though he wasn’t sure how much of her story to believe. She was obviously filled to the brim with pain and—bear or not—she’d apparently seen her fiancé get killed by something.

“Where were you camping?” he asked.

“Way out on the south-west rim of Maupin Lake. It was this place Jason knew from when he was a kid.”

“He grew up around here?” He wasn’t usually very good at initiating conversations with strangers, but it seemed important at the moment. It would keep Kelly talking and hopefully stop her from focusing too much on the pain. It would also help Chris get a better picture of exactly what happened to her.

“No, he grew up just outside of Anchorage. But his dad used to rent a place out here at least twice a year.” She opened her mouth again, as if to add something, but stopped to consider the words first. “He always talked about strange things out in the woods, like these local legends and lore. He talked about people getting lost out here—turned around and disoriented. And now I think maybe they weren’t just legends.”

“Why’s that?” But he thought he already knew. He sensed the trees towering over them and vividly remembered feeling disoriented and slightly dizzy as they’d hurried through the woods while searching for Kelly.

“When I ran from the campsite, away from that thing, I stayed on a little footpath that Jason and I had taken to get to the site. I stayed on it the entire time and somehow…I don’t know. Somehow, I got turned around. And then I heard that thing coming after me. I freaked out and went tearing off into the woods, hoping I could hide from it. And time and time again, I felt like I kept coming back to the same spot. I got dizzy and out of sorts and somehow, I ended up falling in this stupid hole or ravine or whatever and…and…”

Her words had started to come together without any pause for breath between them. For a moment, Chris feared she might be going into some sort of manic fit or shock. He felt silly doing it, but he got down on his knees in front of her, doing his best to lock eyes with her. Digesting all she’d just said, Chris then thought of Bobby’s activity tracker acting up. Maybe there was something to it all, as crazy as it sounded.

Maybe…but for now, Kelly was his primary concern. And it sounded like she might be on the verge of a panic attack.

“Kelly, slow down. For right now, it seems you’re safe. You apparently got away from whatever the thing is.”

“I wonder,” she said, her words now slow and her breathing now resembling something close to normal. “I wonder if it was what Jason sometimes talked about. One of those spirits of the woods. One of those Yupik spirts, or the wendigo.”

“I know you’ve been through a lot,” Chris said. “I can’t even imagine what you must be thinking or going through. But we can’t just attribute all of this to legends. You just called them legends and lore yourself not even two minutes ago.”

“It wasn’t a bear,” she snapped. “And it almost seemed to be playing with me…just sort of teasing, almost.”

Chris wasn’t sure how to respond to that. Actually, he wasn’t sure if he should. After all, there were elements of her story that he found himself sympathizing with. The half of a fox stuffed under the hood of the SUV…the savagely gutted deer on their porch…the sense that something had been in the woods last night when he and Bear and been by the firepit. And even then, hadn’t he felt like whatever had been out there wasn’t just watching them with caution, but almost studying them?

The thought of it sent a chill through Chris, and it had nothing to do with the cold.

“Did you ever hear about any of that?” Kelly asked. “The spirits, the wendigo, the haunted forests?”

“Briefly,” he said. “The pilot that flew us out here mentioned them, but it was in an offhanded sort of way. He said the stories were nonsense, but that people did tend to get lost and sometimes stranded in these woods—even locals.”

“It’s true. From what I hear, at least two or three people a year die in these woods. Now and then, someone goes missing in the colder months and they find their remains during the warmer parts of the year.” She looked to her hands, still shivering and with what appeared to be a permanent frown on her face. “Thanks for this, by the way,” she said, nodding to the gel pack resting in her gloved hands. “It’s already helping.”

“Is there anything else I can do?”

“How are you at making fires? Nothing big…just something to stay warm by.”

“Not the best, I’m afraid. I was never much of a boy scout.”

“I’ve got a lighter in my pack,” she said, nodding to the little satchel to her right. Somehow, in the craziness of the moments that had passed since they found her, he had overlooked it.

“Then yes, I think I can manage a fire.” He reached for her pack and, trying to inject some humor into the situation, he said: “I don’t guess you have a cell phone that gets signal in there, do you?”

“No. It’s in there, but it’s dead. And besides, as I’m sure you already know, there’s no signal out here. There’s no signal at all until you get back out towards Birch and even then, it’s iffy.”

Chris opened the pack and rummaged around until he found the lighter in a little pocket in the back. The small pocket also contained three tightly rolled joints. He took the lighter out and put it in his own pocket. He then looked up and down the ravine, frowning at the scrawny, wet branches and other burnable debris. There wasn’t much to choose from, but he figured he could make something work.

Without speaking, he started walking to the right, where he saw a decent-sized tree top that had fallen into the ravine. With Kelly grunting and moaning lightly in pain behind him, Chris set out to see if he could manage to start a fire.`,

      content: `Bobby’s stomach was a sludgy mess within seconds of turning away from the ravine, the creek bed, the injured girl, and Chris. He knew most of it was anxiety and nerves. After all, none of them could have imagined just how screwed up this trip would become. Somehow, his revelation of his affair with Vicki seemed minor now.

There was the injured woman, the beef with Chris, Bear threating to assault him, the dead animals, and now they were apparently lost in the woods. Throw a couple of beers on all of those nerves, and you got an upset stomach. It wasn’t the gassy sort of stomach he sometimes got when he drank cheap canned beer, but a tight knot that seemed to thrum and then cramp. He thought it might be what it felt like to be stabbed.

He was walking behind Noah, with Bear in the lead. Bobby was pissed that Bear had made the decision for the entire group and left the rifle back with Chris. Bobby figured if he took the time to think about the situation, he might finally agree with it. That was hard to do, though, when the man whose wife he was screwing around with currently had a gun and they did not. Of course, Chris was stranded in a crack in the ground, so no harm, no foul there.

“I’ll go ahead and say it,” Noah muttered about five minutes after leaving Chris behind. “I thought we’d be back on the road by now.”

“Not just yet,” Bear said. He pointed a few yards away to their right. “You can just barely make out our footsteps in that little bit of snow from where we went off the road the first time.”

“No, those were on our right like two minutes ago,” Noah said.

“I don’t think so. Look, it’s only been like five minutes. It had to have taken us ten or more just to get down there.”

“If you say so,” Noah conceded.

Bobby didn’t bother saying anything. He wasn’t stupid; he understood that he was the joke of the group, the guy who had been invited out of pity even though no one would come out and admit it. Besides, he was also to the point where he was pretty hesitant to say anything in front of Bear. Back at the cabin, there had been a terrifying moment where he thought Bear was going to throttle him. Bobby understood Bear’s approach…he was just trying to keep his friends from fighting any worse than they already had. There was a small part of Bobby that was still enraged from the punch Chris had landed on him last night, right across the face. There was no bruise, but his jaw had been aching when he woke up. It still ached a bit whenever he opened his mouth, which was yet another reason to keep quiet.

As they marched back towards what they hoped was the road, Bobby also tried his best to figure out why he’d wanted to come on this stupid trip. If he’d stayed at home, it would have given him and Vicki five whole days to figure out ways to get together. They hadn’t had sex in Vicki and Chris’s marriage bed, but it was something Vicki kept teasing him with. Yet, at the same time, he knew it was a smart move to go on the trip. Or, rather, it had seemed like a good idea. They had both figured it would be a way to dilute whatever suspicions Chris might already have. But by the time Chris started making his patronizing remarks about drinking back at the store in Birch, Bobby had known this trip was not going to end well. He’d wanted to tell Chris right there in the store, if for no other reason than to shut him up and put him in his place. Looking back, he almost wished he had. It would’ve made for a smoother end to the trip.

As his mind tended to do, he latched on to his sordid memories of his sexual escapades. And, as they had for about the last three or four months, they all involved Vicki. He was almost a decade younger and she knew what she was doing was wrong, but once they were together, she was always eager. It worked out incredibly well for Bobby because those two things combined made her a firecracker between the sheets. She openly admitted to him that she tended to be slightly reserved in bed with Chris. She’d referred to sex with Chris as plain, monotonous and predictable on more than one occasion. Bobby was pretty sure she still loved Chris but was going through something…maybe some sort of female mid-life crisis.

Bobby honestly wasn’t sure why she was doing it. He was reaping the benefits of it, and that’s all he cared about. Yes, he knew it made him a miserable friend, but he was willing to look past that. Forty was quickly approaching and he wasn’t sure how much longer—

“What the hell?” Bear said, breaking Bobby’s wandering train of thought.

“What?” Noah asked.

Bobby looked around, wondering if he had missed something obvious. It tended to happen when his mind was wandering. Even before Bear answered Noah, Bobby knew what Bear had seen: the scattered footsteps Bear had pointed out to the left were gone. The snow to all sides was undisturbed, and there was still no road. Bobby stared down to the ground very hard, wondering if maybe they were on the little pathway, but the edges had been covered in snow. But no…there were leaves, fallen sticks, and rough ground beneath his feet and the snow.

“Did we walk over the damn trail and didn’t even realize it?” Noah asked, apparently seeing the same thing without needing Bear to answer.

“No. I’ve kept my eyes glued to the ground the entire time.”

“So then, where are we?” Bobby asked, finally contributing to the conversation. “Where’d the road go?”

Bear stopped and looked all around, a dawning look of worry taking over his usually calm face. Bobby looked behind them and could clearly see where they had been walking. But he could no longer see the tracks where they had gone down in search of a screaming female voice. He checked his watch and saw that the activity tracker now told him they’d walked one hundred and eighty-six miles. As he watched, the number changed to two hundred and nine.

Scared and frustrated, Bobby’s reaction surprised even himself. He tore the watch off of his arm and tossed it behind them. He let out a frustrated little growl as he did it.

“This makes no sense,” Bear said, ignoring Bobby’s outburst.

“You’re right,” Noah said. “Look, I’ll fully admit that I probably couldn’t find my way out of a wet paper bag. But I thought you knew where you were going. I’ve just been following you, assuming you knew the way.”

“Same,” Bobby said. He was already regretting his tantrum and thinking about going back to retrieve the watch.

“Thanks for the encouragement,” Bear said. “Look, if we can’t—”

A low growling sound interrupted him. It seemed to come from behind them, and when Bobby wheeled around in that direction, he nearly fell on his ass. Bobby was nearly certain it was a bear, but the volume and tone of it almost made it sound like the bear in question was in a tunnel a good distance away.

“Don’t move,” Bear said. “If there’s something there and it sees us and we can’t see it, moving is the worst thing we can do.”

“That seems really stupid,” Bobby pointed out.

All three men remained rooted where they stood. Bobby scanned the forest in all directions and saw nothing—just trees, snow, and grey shards of sky between it all. He listened for the growling noise again, but heard the sound of something moving. It was in front of them and coming slightly from the left. Like the growling noise, it seemed to somehow be on top of them and at some great distance away at the same time.

Bobby held his ground, looking to Bear for further instruction. As he did, Noah surprised both of them and took off in a sprint. He ran back the way they’d originally been heading while trying to get back to the road. He moved so quickly that Bobby could only stare at him for a moment, trying to figure out what was happening.

“Noah!” Bear hissed. “What the hell are…”

But Noah paid no attention. He was running without looking back, his gaze set dead ahead. As Bobby watched, Noah leaped over a fallen log without missing a beat.

Behind them, there was another growling noise. And though it didn’t sound any closer, there was something different about it. It was less like a bear and more like the sound of a gigantic man clearing his throat. The sound sent a spike of fear right through Bobby’s heart. For a second, he feared that his tumultuous stomach was going to betray him and he’d either puke or soil his pants. Before he could do either, his instincts kicked in and he followed after Noah. He ran on legs that felt like they were trembling and he nearly fell twice.

He could hear Bear hissing at them, but he didn’t care. Bobby ran, not daring to look back because he had no interest in seeing what had made that noise. If Bear wanted to stay back there and face whatever it was, let him.

After a few more seconds, though, Bobby heard another pair of footsteps behind him. He made himself turn, just to make sure it was Bear and not something else—a bear or even a moose or whatever else could have made that God awful noise. When he saw that it was Bear with an irritated look on his face, Bobby calmed down considerably.

“Would you idiots stop?” Bear said, his voice loud now, nearly screaming. The fact that he was no longer trying to stay quiet made Bobby think they were no longer in danger—if they ever had been at all.

Bobby stopped first, but Noah kept running for a few steps. When he finally looked back and saw that the coast was clear, he also stopped running. He looked at Bobby and Bear, embarrassed and scared. He was panting for breath and his cheeks had gone red.

“What the hell was that about?” Bear said.

Noah’s eyes were wide with fear and panic. But there was also embarrassment there as he realized how he’d reacted. “I saw…I don’t know…something…”

“Where?” Bear asked.

“Back there! I mean, I think I saw it. Something out in the woods, lurking behind some trees.”

“A bear?” Bobby asked.

“No. I don’t know what it was. Sort of like an ape, I think. But…hell, I don’t know. Now that I’m looking out there, it could have been anything. The trees are just so…I don’t know. I’m not thinking right…”

“You moron,” Bobby wailed. “You think you saw a Yeti?”

“No, Bobby,” Noah said, furious. But then he looked back out into the thick maze of trees with a doubtful look on his face. “Maybe it was nothing…maybe I was just seeing things, the trees and the snow messing with me. But…I thought I saw…”

Bobby looked from Noah to Bear, trying to gauge just how worried he should be. Bear still looked irritated about Noah’s freak-out moment, but he also looked rattled when he glanced to the forest behind them.

“Whether you saw something or not,” Bear said, “the fact remains that we all heard something.”

“We did,” Bobby agreed. “But something that sounds like that…how the hell can it hide behind these trees?”

“Remember how weird Kelly’s voice sounded when we first heard her?” Bear said. “Sound carries very strange out here. As long as we keep our eyes and ears open, we’ll be okay.”

“If we can ever find the road,” Noah added.

Bear nodded, but that was the extent of his agreement. He then made a theatrical welcoming gesture all around them. “Anyone else want to lead the way?”

When neither Bobby nor Noah volunteered, Bear continued forward, scanning the forest for any clue as to where the road might be. Bobby tried not to pay too much attention to him because seeing how clearly lost Bear seemed to be was scary.

And as far as Bobby was concerned, it was starting to seem as if the roads leading back to civilization had disappeared.`,

      content: `“The car won’t start, Jason. The battery must be dead…”

Kelly’s mouth tumbled out these words while she dozed in what looked to be a very broken and pain-fueled slumber. It had been about forty-five minutes since Chris had gotten the fire started. It wasn’t a big fire—roughly three feet across—but he contained it by digging a small pit and bordering it with rocks from the creek. The wet branches and bark he’d gathered took a while to catch, urged on by the two random receipts Chris had found in the bottom of his bag. One was for his beer at the airport and the other for his purchases in Birch. Every few minutes, he’d feed the flames another piece of wood, partially dried by being placed next to the fire. The wood he fed it was also small, most of the pieces about the length of a drinking straw and not much wider than his own hand. Down in the creek bed, there really hadn’t been much to choose from.

He checked his watch and saw that it was just after four o’clock. That meant he’d been down here with Kelly for a little over two hours. It also meant that as long as things were going well for Bear, Noah, and Bobby, they should be arriving at the rescue station within four or five hours…unless, miracle of miracles, they came across someone with a vehicle first.

Chris found it was odd, time actually seemed to be moving by fairly fast. He figured it had been the brief conversation with Kelly and then starting a fire, all things to keep his mind otherwise occupied. He was sure a much more seasoned woodsman could have gotten the fire going in no time, but it had taken him nearly half an hour to get his soggy kindling to light.

He was also beginning to wonder if he could trust his watch. Bobby’s watch has been acting up earlier, so maybe something about the forest—maybe the cold or even just the location itself—was messing with anything electronic. It felt like a paranoid idea but he wasn’t willing to rule anything out.

The soft crackling noises and charred smell that came from his little fire were rather pleasant. It was just enough to provide him with a sense of hope—a hope that everything was going to be okay. A hope that by ten or eleven o’clock tonight, he’d be drinking coffee or hot chocolate in a hotel room. Sure, he’d still have Bobby and his cheating wife to contend with, but that was fine. It seemed the worse this trip got, the more he was looking forward to confronting Vicki when he got home.

“You got the fire going,” Kelly whispered.

Chris turned to her and smiled, wondering how long he’d been lost in his own thoughts. Kelly looked sleepy but appreciative, her eyes hazy and her lips trying to form something akin to a smile.

“Yeah,” Chris said. “I hope it’s enough.”

“It is. Thank you. And if it’s not too much trouble, do you think I could get something to eat? You said you had some food, right?”

“Yes. It’s not exactly a gourmet selection, but it’s edible. Would you prefer a granola bar or peanut butter crackers?”

“Crackers, please.”

Chris dug the pack of crackers out of his bag and tore it open. “How’s the leg feeling?”

“I don’t even feel it right now.” She frowned as she took the crackers from him. “And I assume that’s a bad thing.”

“Do you feel feverish in any way?”

“No,” she said with a shaky grin. “No, I’m too cold to feel feverish. The fire is helping, though.”

“I really wish there was something else I could do for you.”

“Well, the fact that you and your friends showed up may have saved my life. That’s enough for now.”

Chris nodded, they sat in silence for a while. He watched Kelly eat the crackers slowly, washing it down with the water he’d provided earlier. The fire crackled and popped; Chris watched it closely, making sure it didn’t start to flutter out.

“So why did you and your friends come out here anyway?” Kelly asked after the silence seemed to become too much for her.

“Ice fishing. None of us had ever tried it. Not in any serious capacity, anyway.”

“Where are you from?”

“We’re all from California. Not too far away from Sacramento.”

“And you chose to ice fish?” she asked with a shaky smile. It didn’t look right on her face. It was clear that she still had far too much grieving and processing to do before anything resembling a smile belonged on her face. A nice, long stay in a warm room and a cast would be an immense help as well.

Chris wasn’t usually the best when it came to social situations and figuring people out. Most people assumed that because he was a doctor, he was good with people. But what most people failed to realize was that seeing a patient wasn’t the same as having casual chit chat with someone. A patient was a puzzle to be solved, a problem to be fixed. Working as a pediatrician was even easier because when he did have to interact with patients, it was at a child’s level. This allowed him to be truthful and more professional to a parent that only wanted to the cold, hard facts.

“We all wanted to do something different…something we’d never done before. We got one day in before things just sort of went to hell.”

“What kind of hell?”

Chris waited a moment before answering. He had to remind himself that Kelly had just lost her fiancé. It made no sense for her to entertain the fact that local legends about spirits or monsters might have had something to do with it.

“In-fighting between the four of us,” he said. “And maybe some really messed up locals leaving us little gifts.”

“Gifts?”

“Yeah.”

“Do you mean like dead animals?” she asked, shifting uncomfortably. “Like butchered really bad?”

“Exactly,” Chris said, not liking where this conversation was going. “That’s right…you said your fiancé was familiar with the area. Did he ever mention the locals pulling really messed up pranks on visitors?”

“No clue. What I do know is that a day or two before that thing attacked us, we started seeing mauled animals all around our campsite. A deer, a few squirrels. We saw a groundhog that looked like someone had reached inside of it and pulled the entire body inside out.”

She stared at the fire as she finished, as if the flames were pulling the thoughts out of her. After that, they fell into another silence. Slowly, Chris walked over to her and looked at her busted leg.

“If you want, I can take a look at that leg.”

“And tell me what? That it’s broken?”

“I can find out where and how badly.”

“Not right now. Honestly, it’s almost like my body has gotten used to it. I mean…is there anything you can do for it?”

“I could maybe try to brace it, but I’d need to find some suitable branches. And based on my search for firewood, I don’t see that happening.”

“Then I don’t think I need a diagnosis.” She didn’t say it in a rude or demeaning way; she said it as a woman that was tired, had watched her fiancé get butchered, and had then gone running through the cold Alaskan wilderness only to fall into a ravine and break her leg. However, she seemed to be aware of her tone and apologized in a trembling voice. “Sorry. I just…this is a whole lot. I cried all night and morning in this damned hole in the ground and now I guess my grief is coming out by lashing out at you.”

“It’s okay. I can’t even imagine what it must be like. If you need to vent or take it out on someone, I’ll gladly fill those shoes. You can also lay into me for being a doctor and not having anything as basic as a bottle of Aspirin in my pack.”

“I’ll file it away for later,” Kelly said. She tried to smile again, but it turned into a grimace as she set her head back against the inclined ground, protected by the hood of her jacket.

Chris watched her, closed her eyes. He watched her chest rise and fall as her eyes remained closed. He was pretty sure she’d be asleep in another minute or so. Based on her interactions with him, he thought she’d turn out fine whenever help arrived. She wasn’t in shock and was very responsive. There appeared to be no fever, and she had access to water and food. As long as his friends (and Bobby) didn’t run into any trouble, he thought Kelly would make it out of his just fine.

He kept this assumption at the forefront of his mind as he looked up into that grey sky, which seemed to be pushing the day away in its hurry to let night fall.`,

      content: `Bear knew they were hopelessly lost, but he decided not to tell Noah and Bobby…not yet, anyway. It wasn’t because he was embarrassed to admit that he’d gotten them lost, though; it was because he had no idea how they’d gotten lost. It simply made no sense. Once he’d lost track of the footprints they’d stomped in the snow on their way down to the little ravine, Bear had started using a downed tree as a guidepost. It was an easy tree to pick out because the place where it had snapped near the base resembled a very abstract W shape.

They had not turned or veered or even slightly angled away from their course. As far as Bear could tell, they’d remained in a straight line. And yet, somehow, they’d passed that fractured tree three times.

He’d finally resorted to using the compass feature on his phone again. He’d avoided it until now simply because of the way Bobby’s activity tracker had acted. Bear feared that he’d try his compass and find that it, too, was malfunctioning. And if that were the case, that meant there was something going on in these woods that was screwing with their electronics. And that was not something he was ready to consider. He felt that going there would be an invitation to panic and illogical thinking…and that would make the situation infinitely worse.

When Bear pulled his phone out, Noah and Bobby did the same thing. It was almost like they’d been waiting for permission, and it didn’t help to ease bear’s mind at all.

“What the hell?” Noah said.

Bobby let out a nervous laugh and for a moment, Bear thought he was going to throw his phone out into the woods in the same way he’d tossed his watch. Bear looked at his phone and understood their frustration. His compass was wavering all over the place, around and around, stopping, then going back the other way.

“Anyone else’s working?” Bear asked, defeated.

“No,” Noah said.

“To hell with that,” Bobby sneered, shoving the phone back into his pocket. “I mean what the actual hell is going on out here?”

Bear shook his head, and they walked on.

That had all happened five minutes ago, and ever since then, Bear had become legitimately scared. It was one thing to hear strange noises in the woods and to maybe have seen an animal or creature several yards away in the woods. But it was quite another to watch a compass (even if it was little more than an app on a cellphone) spin around sporadically while standing perfectly still.

They’d said very little since then. Bear could tell Bobby and Noah were unnerved, too. Bear wondered if, like him, they were starting to recall the legends Jay had told them. Bear was not into the paranormal at all, but a few of the kids he’d taught were. Sometimes, when kids came into class early, he’d hear them talking about movies and TV shows, or viral clips on TikTok. It was mostly stuff from the Marvel movies or Fortnite gibberish, but a few years back he’d had two young guys that had been quite interested in those wretched ghost hunting shows. He’d overheard them talking about how ghosts and supernatural energies supposedly wreaked havoc on all manner of electronics. It could drain battery power, make recorded images go fuzzy, and things like that.

He wondered if Jay’s Yupik spirits could manipulate their phones somehow.

You idiot, he told himself. Even if you’re really going to allow yourself to consider it, it makes no sense. Could spirits cause you to get turned around and lost? Could they manipulate your senses the same way you’re thinking they can manipulate your phones?

The scary thing was that, based on Jay’s stories about people getting lost out here, he supposed it could be considered. Only, Bear didn’t believe in ghosts. Still, it did very little to ease the genuine fear that was clenching tightly at his heart. The slowly descending darkness of night wasn’t helping matters, either.

Bobby broke the silence, and when he did, his voice was trembling. Bear wasn’t sure if he was cold, scared, or both. Probably both.

“What are we supposed to do if we don’t find the road by night? I mean, let’s be honest here…this makes no sense. Bear, I know you didn’t get us lost. There’s something wrong with these woods and if we don’t figure out what it is, we’re going to freeze to death. So, do we want to go ahead and get the craziness out in the open?”

“What craziness?” Noah asked.

“Are you kidding me?” Bobby scoffed. “You’re the one who claimed you saw a monster or something out in the woods. And a walk to the road that should have only taken us about fifteen minutes is now creeping up on about two hours. There’s something not right here and I really don’t want to be the one to come out and say these woods are haunted or something, but…does anyone have any better theories? That pilot…Jay…he told us, man. I thought he was just joking, you know?”

“I did, too,” Bear said. “But even I have to admit that there’s something very wrong here. I know we’ve been going straight. But somehow we keep passing the same landmarks—the same trees, the same sticks I’ve been jabbing in the ground as posts. And we all saw what the compasses on the phones were doing. I mean, we can pretend there’s some electromagnetic disturbance out here to make ourselves feel somewhat better, but…I don’t know.”

“It’s hard to admit it might be ghosts, right?” Bobby said with a crooked grin on his face.

“Not ghosts,” Noah said, his voice suddenly very grave. “That thing I saw…”

“That thing you think you saw,” Bobby pointed out.

“Yeah. That. Whatever it was, it wasn’t a ghost.”

“Okay, so let’s take a vote,” Bear said. “The direction we’ve been thinking of as straight is not working. Do we veer off to the right or left?”

“I say the right,” Noah said. “Unless I’m really backwards on this, that would be the direction we were heading when we were on the road, right? It should take us in the direction of the rescue station.”

“You’d think so,” Bear said. “Is that what we want to do?”

“I’m not even going to pretend to know,” Bobby said. “So as far as I’m concerned, we can just—”

Bear saw the thing coming through the trees a split second before Bobby did.

He opened his mouth to say something, but his brain seemed to freeze. What he saw made no sense. It seemed too small, and it seemed to be floating, maybe flying…

By the time he’d made any sort of sense out of it, the object slammed hard into Bobby’s chest. There was a smacking noise as the thing collided with him, and then a soft sort of thunk as it hit the ground. Bobby stumbled back, nearly falling. He screamed out in terror, a noise he closed down when he realized he wasn’t in any serious danger.

All three men let out a curse at the same time, each choosing a different one. Bobby started to laugh, but there was nothing funny about it. It sounded like a man locked away somewhere deep inside an asylum, boarded up and totally forgotten.

“What the hell?”

On the ground at Bobby’s feet lay the severed head and partial torso of a fox.

One of its eyes was missing and, it grinned up at them with a toothy, dead smile. Blood was matted to its fur but it was mostly dried, indicating that the fox had been dead for a while.

Bear knew with eerie certainty that this was the upper half of the fox they’d found stuffed under the hood of the SUV. Bobby apparently realized this at about the same time because he wheeled around in the direction the fox’s head had come from and started to yell. It was more than screaming. It was more like the shrieking of a madman.

“Oh, that’s really cute!” he screamed. “You’ve been following us? Come on out, then! Come on out if you think you’re so funny! If you think you’re so tough!”

While it was scary to hear Bobby screaming in such a way, it was even scarier to understand exactly what had happened. If it was indeed locals that had stuffed the other half of this fox under the hood of the SUV, they had apparently been following them, waiting for the right time to drop this latest bomb on them. Yet, as soon as this theory formed, Bear knew it was impossible. How had someone been following them if they were helplessly lost? If there were locals trailing them, were they also getting turned around along with them? And how in God’s name had they stayed out of sight this whole time and remained so quiet? Something about it seemed even more impossible than how badly lost they’d gotten.

“Bobby, calm down,” Bear said, trying to sound calm.

“No! If there’s some bored, loser locals out there getting their jollies off on slaughtering animals and teasing us with it, they can come out right now! Throwing a fox head at me…what do they even…”

But he started to calm a bit with each word that came out of his mouth. It looked as if he was starting to understand just how odd it all was. Like Bear, who was also hesitant to admit such a thing, it seemed that Bobby was starting to understand that if there was something out there messing with them, it was almost certainly not locals.

“Bear?” Noah said .

“What?”

“You hear that?”

Bear kept quiet for a moment; his head cocked. Bobby stepped in beside him, his coat smeared with gore from the fox’s head. He heard what Noah was referencing almost right away. It sounded like slow, methodical footsteps out in the forest. He thought he could also hear some odd sort of labored breathing, but that could have easily been nothing more than wind passing along the tops of the scraggly trees. Looking out to the layers upon layers of trees, Bear was again reminded, just how close to night they were drawing. Dusk was settling down comfortably, making it harder to see clearly through the trees if they were more than fifty yards away.

The footsteps continued; they didn’t sound as if they were walking away, but almost like they were circling.

“What is that?” Noah asked. Bear had never heard a grown man so scared before. He wondered if Noah was still seeing the glimpse of whatever it was he thought he’d seen earlier, the image now plastered to his mind’s eye. “I mean, just what—”

He was interrupted by what Bear could only describe as a scream. It wasn’t a scream of anger or fear, but some feral sort of warning—not quite a growl but very close. It sounded both human and canine at the same time. As Bear did his best to categorize it, Noah let out a whimper and began to shake his head. He resembled a child scared of the dark, shaking his head at the shadows creeping along his wall, shadows that could grow talons and fangs at any given moment.

And then he took off running again, weeping as he did so. He ran so blindly that he ran directly into a tree. As he spun himself around, he shouted out. At about the same time, the sound of footsteps grew louder. Whatever was out there—whatever had made that ungodly shriek—was coming towards them.

Bear and Bobby went rushing after Noah. For the first time since leaving Chris behind, Bear felt like an idiot for leaving the rifle behind. But rather than beat himself up over that, he ran. He ran harder than he could remember running anytime in the past several years. He glanced back a single time and saw something moving behind them. The brief glimpse he caught gave him little to go on, but he thought he saw something that resembled an arm and a lump at the top that was likely a head. Its proportions made no sense to Bear, and he didn’t waste too much time trying to figure it out.

He was barely aware of the moment Bobby passed him, running and dodging trees as if he were some sort of experienced hurdler or track and field pro. Bobby was also making some sort of desperate sound as he ran, not quite a whine, but something a little more grounded. Not too far ahead of him, Noah stumbled, caught himself on a tree, and stumbled back into something resembling a run. Bear passed by him, giving him a brief look to make sure he was still capable of moving on his own.

He then turned back towards the forest ahead of him. Bobby was up there, a few feet ahead, his legs firing on all cylinders. He was cutting slightly to the right, which was fine with Bear. Walking straight hadn’t done any good and at this point, he was willing to try anything. Hell, he’d even walk backwards if…

Just a few feet behind him, Noah let out a blood-curdling scream. It was the sort of scream that came from the heart rather than the lungs, one filled with fear and defeat. It was almost as animal-like as the noise they’d heard from out in the trees moments ago. When Bear turned to see what had happened, he did not stop running. In his moving, he barely caught sight of…well, of what, he wasn’t exactly sure.

He saw Noah, but only from the knees down. The rest of him had been lifted from the ground and was being pulled backwards with what appeared to be impossible speed. For a moment of what felt like insanity, Bear was sure the forest itself had come alive and snatched him up. He watched for a fleeting moment as Noah continued to be hauled into the forest, his feet barely dragging along the ground as some unseen hand held him.

Only, it wasn’t unseen.

Bear could see what had Noah, though only for a moment. He saw something tall, something with slumped shoulders, a bulbous head, something with arms that looked impossibly long and hands that—

Bear, still running as he peered behind him, didn’t see the stump in front of him. His right shin struck it and he fell, pinwheeling his arms out and catching nothing. His right cheek slammed into the forest floor, the brittle ground and snow scraping him. His shin screamed in pain and for a second, he thought he’d snapped his leg. But then the terror of what he thought he had just seen went rocketing through him and he got back up to his feet with no problem.

He looked back one last time, trying to understand the primal fear that had seized him. It was a potent emotion, something he’d never experienced before. It was feverish and almost nauseating, like a surge of adrenaline but laced with poison. And though he tried to fight it, when Bear saw that there was no longer any sign of Noah or the unnamable thing that had taken him, the fear claimed him.

It propelled him forward, chasing after Bobby, and leaving Noah to whatever had come out of the forest for him.

At some point in his running, Bear cried for his friend. He screamed and wept and let the tears flow. But he ran all the same, his mind now scarred by the sight of the oddly shaped creature and the way it had carried Noah off as if he was nothing more than a discarded carcass lying on the forest floor.`,

      content: `Bobby wasn’t sure how long he’d been running. What he did know was that he would have run even farther and harder if his lungs didn’t feel like they were on the brink of collapse. When he made himself stop, he didn’t mean to fall over, but he did. He hit the ground and was so wiped out from running that he thought he might puke. He could feel his stomach starting to heave, could taste the cheap beer trying to make a second appearance.

He heard Bear coming up beside him. Bear had been whimpering a bit for the last few, minutes and Bobby didn’t think it had anything to do with the sudden burst of running.

Bobby had heard Noah…the way he’d screamed and then the way he’d stopped screaming. He’d heard Bear’s footsteps, alone and solitary behind him. Even without looking back to confirm it, Bobby knew Noah was gone. He wasn’t sure how and God help him; he didn’t think he wanted to know.

“No,” Bear croaked as he fell to his knees beside Bobby. “Up. Get up. Have to run.”

“I don’t think I can.” This was mostly true. His knees felt like they had exploded and his chest felt like someone had stuck a steel rod through it. He could barely breathe, much less run. Based on how he felt, even just walking was going to be a chore for the foreseeable future.

“I saw it,” Bear said, panting for breath as he turned to look behind them. Bobby looked in that direction, too, and saw nothing but a darkening forest. How long were we running? he wondered. It wasn’t this dark when we started, was it?

“Saw what?” Bobby asked.

“What took Noah. It was…almost like a man, but the proportions…it made no sense.”

“Bullshit.”

Bear wheeled around on him and got in his face, so close that they were nearly nose-to-nose. Bobby nearly got to his feet because he’d never seen such anger coming out of Bear. more than that, he’d never seen the man afraid of anything. It was jarring.

“I know what I saw! I know it makes no sense, but I saw it! This messed up looking thing with long arms and a weird-shaped head. It had to be at least eight feet tall.”

“Then how have we not seen it before now?” Bobby challenged. He was starting to get angry because it hurt to speak. He had to fight for each breath he took in. “Something that big can’t just hide behind the trees and sneak around all quiet, Bear! How’s that possible?”

“I don’t know! It’s almost like it blends in. It’s…God, I don’t know…”

“So, Noah’s gone,” Bobby said. Speaking it out loud, it landed heavier. It was so heavy that he said it again and this time it took the wind out of him. “Noah’s gone…”

Chris was back in a ravine with an injured woman, and now Noah was gone. Not only that, but they were apparently stranded in these frigid, unforgiving woods, hunted by a monster smart enough to butcher a fox and use both parts of its carcass to taunt them at different times of the day. It was so terrifying that it almost made him start laughing—an appropriate response, in his opinion, to something that made no sense.

“Yeah, he’s gone,” Bear said, shaking his head. “How…I mean…what the hell?”

“Don’t do this,” Bobby said, finally finding it tolerable to draw in a breath. “You can’t lose your head. If you go nuts, we’re screwed. I have no idea what to do. You have to”

“I don’t know what to do, either!” Bear yelled. “No one would! We can’t find the road and even if we wanted to try getting back to Chris, I guarantee you we wouldn’t be able to find him!”

“Well, we have food and water, right? Maybe we stop running blindly through the woods like idiots for a second. Stay put. Get a sense of what’s going on.”

It felt weird to be barking orders at Bear; though Bobby would never openly admit it, the big man was more or less the leader of their group. He could see Bear’s eyes shifting, scanning the forest. There was a fleeting fright in his gaze, but there was also a very obvious attempt to stay in control. It freaked Bobby out to watch Bear struggle with something like this. For Bear to be so rocked by something…it made Bobby assume that Bear had seen something take Noah and whatever that thing had been, it had surely been terrible.

Slowly, Bear started to speak. When he did, it was clear that he wasn’t so much talking to Bobby as he was speaking to himself, trying to come up with a game plan of some sort and processing it out loud.

“Yeah, just running through the woods in the dark isn’t going to accomplish anything.” His voice trembled as he wrestled with emotion, clearly not yet having processed what happened to Noah, or what he had seen. “But as it gets darker, it’s going to get colder. If we move, we stay warm. But I have no idea where we are, much less where the road is. We just…well, let’s see. What have we got in our packs?”

Bobby shrugged him off and started looking through it right away. If this is what it took to get Bear to remain calm, then he was all for it. The simple truth of the matter was that if Bear lost his mind, they were both royally screwed. So, Bobby looked through his pack obediently and started listing off the items he came to. In that moment, if Bear had asked him to do a waltz and juggle pine cones, he would have done it.

“One more coat, not very thick,” Bobby said. “Another pair of socks. A few snacks, a few more cans of beer, some water, another pair of gloves. And that’s it.”

Bear nodded as he slowly started going through his pack and making his own list. “A lighter, some food, some water, some hand warmer packs, extra gloves…that’s all. I knew it was going to be a long walk, but I had no idea it would end up like this. I should have packed more.”

“You just said it, man,” Bobby said. “There was no way you could have known it would come to this. None of us could.”

Bear sighed, trembling a bit as the woods grew darker and darker around them. “You’re right. But I think we need to keep moving. That way, at least we have some hope of finding the road. Sitting still, we’re getting nothing accomplished. Besides…now we have the road and Noah to find.”

“I thought you said he—”

“Until I know otherwise, I’m going to assume he’s alive.”

“Fair enough.”

He still felt absolutely worn out from the manic running, and the mere thought of walking through the woods once again was excruciating. But if the alternative was standing around in the dark like a couple of morons, waiting for some odd beat to come out of the forest to snatch them up, he’d walk until his legs fell off. Oddly enough, he didn’t feel all that cold. Maybe it was all the running, or the fear eating slowly at him like acid.

He watched as Bear took out his cellphone again. He checked the compass, shook his head in frustration when he found it still acting sporadic, and shoved it back into his jacket pocket. He took one final look around the forest, taking a panoramic sort of view, and started walking at a hard right angle.

Without question, Bobby followed him. For all Bobby knew, they could be walking towards a cliff or the very edge of the earth. And honestly, that would be fine with him. At least then the mystery would be over. He didn’t want to die, but he also didn’t know how much longer he’d be able to handle the uncertainty of it all. He didn’t know how much longer he’d be able to walk through these seemingly endless forests without losing his mind. He peered ahead and found that it was now too dark to see anything more than twenty feet ahead of them.

For now, there were only snow and trees, and an encroaching darkness that seemed to have claws, ready to sink into him and tear him apart.`,

      content: `Chris was dreaming again and this time as he flew up above the trees, he could see things moving around in the treetops. Maybe they were squirrels, or maybe birds. Or maybe the movement wasn’t coming from creatures at all. Maybe it was the forest, living and breathing and letting him know that it was part of him—that it breathed as he breathed, its heart beat along with his, and they were one and the same. He could feel each and every tree and he glided over them, felt the roots all reaching blindly underground in search of water, felt the worms and beetles writhing in the bark, felt the bloom, growth and dry, brittle death of every leaf and pine needle.

The forest was his home, and he was home to the forest.

This time, he was also much more aware of himself. He wasn’t necessarily flying, but simply looking down. It was much how he’d once viewed God. He looked down from up on high, staring down at a world that belonged to him. He saw every movement, every flicker of light. He glided over it all and the forest seemed to never end. He felt raindrops on his face, warm and rather heavy. It was sticky and oddly thick, in a way that—

Chris snapped awake with a gasp.

The flurrying images of the treetops and the glimpses of ground beneath them remained plastered to his waking mind for about five seconds as his eyes took in the darkness of the ravine. Oddly enough, he could still feel the pattering of rain he’d felt on his face in the dream. He reached up to his face and wiped it away, even though he was quite certain it wasn’t there at all.

He looked to the right, over to where Kelly was napping fitfully. She groaned every now and then, and her teeth were chattering almost constantly. Chris had placed his extra coat over her, but it seemed to have done no good. He’d checked her over not long before he’d accidentally dozed off, and was confident that she was still not in any real mortal danger. She was cold, sure. But she was not showing signs of hypothermia, she wasn’t feverish, and her breathing seemed to be mostly okay. The fire blazed beside them, growing smaller and in need of more wood. He’d get up to do just that after he’d checked on her, he supposed.

Chris sat up, preparing to head over to her, when he felt another pelt of rain on his head. Confused, as he thought the rain had been part of his dream, he wiped it away from his head again. This time, he noticed something different about it.

It felt sticky and sort of warm.

He glanced at his hand in the weak light of the fire and saw a red smear along the inside of his palm. Was he bleeding? Was he…

Chris looked up at the sky. It was dark and just slightly cloudy. He saw twinkling stars quite clearly, somehow both bright and diminished all at the same time in the sea of black overhead. Yet when he pulled his vision back, looking not at the grandeur of the sky but his immediate surroundings, he saw the weird shape perched slightly over his head. He couldn’t tell what it was at first, but as his eyes adjusted to the dying light of the fire, the edges and curves of it molded together.

He screamed before he was aware of what he was doing.

He scrambled to his feet and backed away, not aware that his screams and stirred Kelly awake.

Hanging about a foot or two off of the ground that served as the ravine and creek bed, a body was hanging upside down. From what Chris could tell, it was hanging from a tree near the edge of the bank. It hung from a tree limb, arms stretched down and head snapped back. The blood, though, was coming from its stomach. The body had bene torn open and some of its insides had tumbled out, some dangling as low as the outstretched arms. Even in the weak light, they glistened in a maddening sort of way.

The stuff dripping on Chris’s head was the blood cascading down the body. There wasn’t much of it, running down from the gash in the stomach, up the chest and over the chin. The body was naked except for a glove and a single boot, the laces of which hung down in a terrible parody of the intestines that seemed to have kept the body hanging in the tree. The body was male, his extremities hanging just like everything else. Its mouth was open wide in a scream and the top right portion of his skull was exposed, the skin and muscle ripped away.

Chris felt himself starting to chant something, he wasn’t even sure what it was. A string of curses at first, then a prayer of some kind, then curses again. As soon as he was aware of this, Kelly let out a scream behind him. It was high pitched, skull shattering, and broke apart into maniacal weeping at the end.

Chris’s first thought, that had not yet had the time to take root and fully form, was that the dead, naked man hanging from the tree by his guts was Bear, Noah, or Bobby. But the face wasn’t quite right. Before he could properly begin to wonder who it might be, Kelly’s screams answered that question for him. This was her fiancé—Jason, he thought his name was.

The handful of seconds that followed made Chris feel like he had stepped out of reality for a moment. He had never heard anyone scream in such a way before. He was fully expecting Kelly’s throat to turn itself inside out at any moment. She started shrieking hysterically; the sound coming out in minor hitches and yips. She pressed herself back against the steep embankment, blindly using both legs. Her right leg bent uselessly, but she was apparently oblivious to the pain in the face of such a shock.

Her hands went to her face and it seemed that she was going to cover her eyes at first, but instead, she started pounding at the sides of her head. It seemed like she was trying to knock the sight right out of her eyes and Chris honestly didn’t blame her. With each strike, the screams that came from her mouth seemed reverberate and go careening further down into the ravine. It was quite clear that she was going into shock—that this ghastly sight was the thing that was going to finally push her over the edge after the harrowing two days she’d just experienced.

“Kelly, stop that,” he said, knowing it was a stupid command. She probably didn’t hear him. She probably wasn’t even aware that he was still there.

He went to her and dropped to his knees. Taking her wrists in his hands to stop her from striking herself, he could feel the shivers running through her body like electricity. She fought with him, but even though he was looking her right in the eyes, Chris could tell that she was barely even aware that he was there. She angled her head to keep her eyes on the sight of her butchered lover, hanging from the tree. She was not blinking and the shallow breaths she drew in between yelps and screams were getting raspy.

His instinct told him to slap her across the face. While it was an overused movie trope, he knew that it did work. But something about striking her in the midst of what she was going through seemed tragically wrong and absurd. Instead, he released her arms and took three large strides back towards his pack, nearly stepping in the little fire as he did so. While tearing through his pack for a water, he saw a pool of gathered blood directly beside the place he had been dozing. And as he took the water from his bag, another drop from the corpse hanging overhead dripped down onto his arm.

As a trained medical professional, his primary impulse was geared towards helping those in need. That’s the only thing that sorted his logic in that moment, trying anything he could think of to get Kelly to come around. Even still, there was a panicked voiced in the back of his mind, tinged with lunacy, that brought up a very good point.

What sort of animal could do that to a man? Not just maul him and gut him, but then have the intelligence to string him from a tree by his guts?

He tossed up a mental shield at this thought. There was nothing sensical there, nothing to help Kelly in her current situation. Nothing to distract him from how absolutely insane this entire situation had become.

Water in hand, Chris turned back around to Kelly. At the same moment, her screams abruptly stopped. In the dim light of the fire, Chris saw something come down the embankment and close in on her, reaching for her. At first, his already puzzled mind insisted that it was a tree—that a tree had come to life and reached down to grab Kelly. Even the tips of the branches were visible as they enveloped her head. But then his eyes and brain worked together to see something beyond that madness.

It was not a tree, but a very long and scrawny arm. The tips of the branches were fingers, reaching and gripping and—

No, he insisted. That’s stupid. That’s not…no…not real. Can’t be…

But even as he told himself this, he watched as the skeletal-looking things that might be fingers or branches clutched Kelly’s head. She let out one last scream, a brief sort of gurgling rasp, before she was snatched up. It lifted her entire body from the ground in one sudden movement. Dirt and debris from the embankment rained down as Chris rushed over, hoping to grab her.

But then he saw the shape at the top of the embankment. It was mostly shrouded in shadows, but he could see the contours of it by the weak firelight. He saw shoulders, a head, and what looked like a distorted face.

A deer, he thought. Antlers, right there. And the long, extended snout. That’s a deer…

Of course, it was not a deer.

But it was the only thing his mind could fathom in that moment. The noise that came from the top of the embankment pulverized even that thought. Whatever was up there let out a muffled grunt. It sounded almost like a restrained howl.

This was followed by a small whine from Kelly, and then something that sounded like a melon being dropped on a grocery store floor. He was afraid he knew what this sound was right away, and then got visual confirmation.

The top portion of Kelly’s head came spilling down the embankment. Her skull had been crushed and her right eye slid right out of the fractured socket as it struck the ground. His mind, not accustomed to grotesqueries like this, did its best to see it as a shattered jack-o-lantern, but it was a ruse that lasted less than a second.

Something that felt like fear but with a sharper edge exploded inside of Chris. It was not like anything he’d ever felt before. His heart seemed to swell three sizes and for a moment, he thought he might wet himself. Whatever the emotion was, it took control of his brain and every nerve within him.

He started running, tearing his eyes away from that impossible shape eight feet above him, standing on the other side of the embankment. On one side, a monstrous form with arms like stripped trees, fingers like weak branches, and a head shaped like a deer; on the other side, a gutted human with his insides spilling out. And in the ravine with him, half of a woman’s head.

It was insanity, and that was why he ran. He tried to escape not just the sight and impossibility of it all, but the knowledge that he might very well lose his mind if he didn’t run away from it all. At the very last moment, he saw the rifle. As he sped by, he reached out and blindly grabbed it, carrying it by the barrels. He didn’t even think of turning to shoot at the thing on the embankment. He knew it would do no good. It would be like firing bullets into smoke, into a living nightmare. He couldn’t shoot the thing, because it wasn’t really there, right?

His mind insisted otherwise, and he continued to run, finding a gear he didn’t even know he possessed. As if to back up his mind’s inclination, the thing on the embankment made a raspy sort of chuffing noise, and then there was the sound of footsteps.

Chris could only run. The darkness of the ravine made it impossible for him to see more than three feet ahead. His feet pounded the unsteady ground, his ankle nearly bending too far in the wrong direction several times. At one point, he saw a small boulder about a half second too late; his left leg struck it, sending a surge of agony from his ankle to his knee. He went sprawling forward, throwing his hands up just in time to protect his face from crashing into the top of the boulder. The rifle went skidding and thumping away on the sand, snow, and rocks ahead of him.

With a cry, Chris got up, retrieved the rifle and dared a look back. He thought he saw something moving up there along the rim of the ravine. It was not fast, but moved like a lurking shadow pushed along by a sun that wasn’t there. It was enough to keep him running. He felt whimpers and screams rising inside of him, but he managed to swallow them down. If he let them out, that would be the end of it. He’d succumb to the madness and he might live long enough to feel his mind slipping away before that thing was upon him.

He wasn’t sure how long he’d been running when he slipped on the ice—maybe five minutes, maybe five hours. He didn’t know. But when the world tilted and went end over end, he was sure he was dead. He slammed hard on the ground, banging his head on a rock about the size of a softball. Little rockets of light flared across his vision and before he knew it, the stars in the sky started to grow dim. He thought of getting to his feet, but the darkness was coming in too fast—so fast that he barely had time to realize that by blacking out, he would be vulnerable to that thing up on the embankment.

Chris had just one brief moment of abject terror before the darkness fell over him in a surprisingly comforting way.`,

      content: `Bear heard the gentle commotion behind him when Bobby collapsed. He wasn’t sure how long they’d been walking, but it felt like days. The darkness had gotten thicker, so dark and all-encompassing that it almost felt like he was walking through a living sort of tar. He could feel the night, thick and weighing against him. The trees seemed to be pushing him down and though it was a childish thought, he could not help but feel that even if they were getting closer to the trail, the forest would not allow it. The snow on the ground was causing his eyes to ache, a stark contrast to the utter darkness everywhere else.

He turned and found Bobby on the ground, starting to slowly get up. He was breathing deeply, each breath ragged and thin. There was an annoyed and pained look on his face that Bear hoped was anger. This was a situation where a little anger might go a very long way as a means of motivation.

“You okay?”

“No,” Bobby spat. “No, I’m not.”

“Okay, so let’s rest a bit.”

“It’s not just the running,” Bobby said. He looked all around the forest with a deep frown set on his face. “We have to admit…” He stopped here to draw in more breath as he finally managed to make it to his knees. “…that something really wrong is going on here. There’s no way it should be taking us this long to find the trail. And Noah…whatever happened to him…”

Bear nodded, because he agreed completely. It was difficult to admit such a thing, but the evidence was certainly there. The forest seemed to be moving on them, adjusting itself so that it always kept the road away from them. There was now also the thing he had seen come out of the forest to snatch Noah up. Maybe it was the night around them or being isolated for the rest of the world, but accepting a supernatural reason for their current situation was getting easier and easier.

“Still,” Bear said. “I think it might be for the best if we stop for a minute. Maybe try to re-orient ourselves.”

“Good luck with that. Between the trees, the woods, and whatever the hell is chasing after us, I don’t know where we are. For all I know, we could be in Colorado somewhere.”

Bear found a nearby fallen log, wiped the thin sheet of snow from the top, and sat down. He rummaged around in his bag for water. When he took it out, he saw the lighter sitting in the bottom of the pocket as well. The idea of sitting by a fire was blissful; he hadn’t realized just how cold he was until he envisioned flames crackling beside him.

“I’m going to start a fire,” Bear said. “Just a small one.”

“So just sort of letting that thing out there know where we are?” Bobby scoffed.

“If there is something out there—and I’m pretty sure there is now—I bet you anything, it already knows where we are. It’s messing with us, whatever it is. Me making a fire isn’t going to tip it off any more than it already is.”

Bobby nodded and shrugged at the same time. “Good point. And I won’t argue anymore because I’m just starting to realize that I can’t feel my nose.”

Together, they rounded up a collection of sticks and branches. As Bobby knocked the snow off of them and cleared an area along the ground, Bear went to a nearby tree and peeled some of the bark away. Using his pocketknife, he chipped even further into the bark to get to the dry wood underneath. When he had enough kindling, he did his best to start making a fire. It would not catch easily, so he ended up going into his wallet for more fuel. He took out a paper punch card from a local coffee chop back home and the receipt for the new dishwasher his wife had picked out two weeks ago. Thinking about such a mundane task sent a spike of pain through him. Would he ever see his wife again? Would they ever get the chance to take the faulty dishwasher back and exchanged it for one that actually worked?

He felt strange as he fed both items to the struggling fire. It felt like giving up, like accepting that he’d never need either of those things again. Within five minutes, there was a respectable fire going. Within ten minutes, they had to brush back more foliage, so they didn’t catch the forest on fire.

As they warmed themselves by the fire, the flames created eerie plays of light and shadow on the trees all around them. In that moment, it was far too easy to believe the forest was alive and, if it wanted, could swallow them down into the earth. Bear felt a dull sort of weariness sinking into him. His body was exhausted, but his nerves were too frazzled to even think about napping. Terror was apparently very much like adrenaline, in that he felt absolutely drained.

“You think it’s ghosts?” Bobby asked out of nowhere. “Spirits, or whatever?”

As Bear thought of the best way to answer, he saw that Bobby had taken out another beer and was sipping from it in an almost guilty fashion. Bear said nothing about it. In fact, he nearly asked if he could have one.

“I don’t know how to answer that,” Bear answered. “I don’t believe in ghosts. I never have, not even as a kid. Just seems stupid—like a lazy way to explain away certain things people don’t have an answer for.”

“But you believe in God, right?”

“I do. I’m impressed that you even know that about me.”

“So how can you believe in an invisible man in the sky that loves and condemns you at the same time, but you can’t quite make the reach to assume that there are legendary spirits playing around with us right now?”

“Because I’ve felt God—or at least some presence or power that I believed to be God—in my life. This…whatever is happening…yeah, I think it might be something evil or maybe even just some weird…”

“Some weird what?” The fire danced in Bobby’s eyes, soft amber glows resting on the beer can hovering by his lips

“I don’t know.” But he thought he did. He just didn’t want to say it out loud.

“Maybe get on the line to that God of yours and tell him we need some serious help down here,” Bobby said.

Bear felt like Bobby was just trying to get a rise out of him, so he let the comment go. Maybe this was just Bobby’s way of dealing with stress…by drinking and doing his best to piss people off.

“Let’s say it is ghosts,” Bear said. “What can we do about it?”

“No clue,” Bobby said without a thought. “But if we can’t shake this thing that’s after us—this thing that snatched Noah right out of the forest—then I say we leave this fire going and burn the whole place down.”

When Bobby mentioned Noah, his voice cracked a bit. He didn’t seem necessarily saddened by what happened to Noah, though. Like Bear, Bobby seemed to not have fully accepted it yet. More than anything, Bobby felt scared, and he was trying his best not to show it.

“Well, I think if we can—” Bear started, but he was interrupted.

Something growled nearby.

At once, Bobby got to his feet and scanned the forest. Bear remained on his log, unmoving, as he looked out into the trees. Again, he wondered if leaving the gun with Chris had been a mistake.

The growl came again, this time longer and more drawn out. It didn’t sound like the noises they’d heard earlier in the day. While these growls were certainly threatening, they at least sounded familiar. And as Bear slowly looked from left to right, taking in as much of the area around them as he could, he saw something else that his mind could at least put some sort of label on.

“Right there,” Bear whispered, still perched on the log. “To the right and look slightly down. See those eyes?”

Bobby looked where Bear had described. A few seconds later, he let out a curse.

“Probably a wolf,” Bear said.

“You say that like it’s not a big deal,” Bobby hissed right back. “You hiding a gun I don’t know about?”

“If you’d shut up, it might just go away.” Bear thought this was true, but wasn’t sure. Most of what he knew about wildlife came from watching shows on National Geographic. He tried to recall if wolves were one of those animals that were more scared of humans than the other way around.

Not able to properly remember, Bear looked around for a suitable stick that they may have overlooked when building their fire. He found one at the base of a nearby tree that looked like it might be somewhat dry. He placed the end of it into their fire and waited for it to catch. He did all of this without taking his eyes off of the wolf. It was still moving out there, though it was not advancing. It seemed to be staking out the area, heading around them in a circle. Bear hoped this was a lone wolf; if several other sets of eyes popped up out there in the darkness, they might be royally screwed.

He picked up the new stick out of the fire and was relieved to see that the end had caught aflame. He slowly advanced towards the set of eyes, the flames wavering in the dark above him. He took three steps in total before the set of glowing eyes started to back away. Working up the little bit of courage he still possessed, Bear took two more strides forward, faster than the last set.

The wolf responded by turning tail and running away. He could see its shape clearly now, its shoulder hunched and to the ground, its backside raised slightly. Bear supposed it had been a lone wolf, after all. As Bear stood in place, he could hear the patter of the wolf’s feet as he ran deeper off into the woods. Maybe we should follow after him, Bear thought. Maybe he could lead us back to the path.

“I won’t lie,” Bobby said, his voice still dropped low to a whisper. “That was impressive. Not sure if it was brave or stupid, but it was impressive. Think you can do that with whatever that thing is that snatched up Noah?”

Annoyed and still rattled by the encounter with the wolf, Bear tossed the stick back into the fire. “Doubtful. You think you can not incessantly run your mouth?”

“Not likely,” Bobby said, and took a swig of his beer.

“Got another of those?” Bear finally asked, his nerves rattled beyond repair.

“A few.” And then, without being asked, he rummaged around in his bag and tossed a can to Bear.

Bear nodded his thanks and popped the tab. He swallowed deeply from it and then looked back out into the trees. He was looking for the returning set of wolf’s eyes at first but, within a matter of seconds, found that he’d almost welcomed those eyes at this point. Because based on the brief and fragmented glimpses he’d seen of that other thing, he thought a wolf taking them by surprise might be the best thing that could happen to them.

---

They stayed by the fire for another hour or so. The wolf did not return but, a creeping sort of unease descended upon them. Bear wasn’t quite sure how to describe it, but he sensed that now was the time to move. If they stayed here any longer, they risked more wolves or, even worse, the thing that had taken Noah—the thing Kelly had hinted about back at the ravine.

“Want to get moving again?” Bobby asked.

Bear was shocked to hear the question coming from Bobby. He assumed Bobby was also feeling the urge to move. Bear was starting to feel that sitting in place made them sitting ducks. The fire had nothing to do with it. He simply felt that if something out there was indeed after them and knew where they were at all times, it might be getting tired of idly waiting. It might be coming for them at any moment now. Bear felt this almost like a sixth sense and as hard as he tried to shake it, it remained.

After extinguishing the fire, they started walking again, this time heading directly to the north. There was a slight incline to the ground and the temperature seemed to be much harsher than it had been before they made their fire. Bear knew it had to be below freezing and though his layered clothes had done well for most of the day, he could now start to feel the chill sinking into him.

As Bear scanned the trees for more glowing eyes, he started to wonder what might happen if they never found the road. He couldn’t remember if Jay had mentioned people actually getting lost and dying out here. Hadn’t he said they were usually rescued? He also wondered if those that did get lost out here from time to time got as badly turned around as they had.

Badly turned around, he thought ironically. Be real. There’s something else going on out here. Call it paranormal forces of some weird electromagnetic anomaly, but it’s sure as hell more than just being badly turned around.

He glanced at his watch as saw that it had somehow come to be 1:12 in the morning. It seemed impossible in terms of the passage of time, but his body seemed to be in perfect agreement. His back was aching, his knees felt like jelly and—

“Holy shit, and raise a hallelujah,” Bobby said suddenly.

Before Bear could ask what he was talking about, he saw it. About ten yards ahead of them, the forest was interrupted by a thin stretch of flat and uninterrupted ground.

It was the road.

It was lightly dusted from the bit of snow that had fallen earlier in the day, but there it was. Bear surprised himself when he had to restrain a scream of absolute triumph.

Almost comically, Bobby stomped to the trail and sat down right in the middle of it. Bear followed after him, but didn’t allow himself a moment to sit down. Instead, he looked down the trail both ways, trying to figure out which way they needed to go because he had no real idea. They’d gotten so scrambled up in the woods, there was no telling where they had finally come out.

“You don’t know which way by any chance, do you?” Bobby said.

“I don’t. We could have come out on any of the other branching trails that came off of the primary one we took to get to the cabin. But I think our best bet is to…”

He stopped and checked his ear to the air. For a minute there, he thought he’d heard something moving out in the trees. If he had heard it, the sound was far away. And now that he was listening with intent, he didn’t hear it again.

“Our best bet is to what?” Bobby asked.

“Continue the way we were going.” Bear pointed to the right, ahead of them. “Even if it turns out we’re going the wrong way, the trail will come out somewhere.”

“I can get on board with that. At this point, I’d be willing to walk all the way back to Birch if it came down to it.”

Bear agreed, though there was one thing that truly frightened him—one thing he didn’t dare speak out loud to Bobby. If they walked endlessly through the night and somehow ended up back at the cabin, Bear thought he might lose his mind. Logically and in terms of terrain, he didn’t think that would happen, but the forest had proven that there was no such thing as a sense of direction out here. And then there was the matter of how the compasses and watches were behaving.

His only hope now was that the trail might help keep them on the straight and narrow and that somehow, they might be saved by the time the sun came up. But even standing on the road, that seemed like nothing more than a naïve wish.`,

      content: `When Chris opened his eyes, it felt like the back of his head was going to fall out. He’d had worse headaches for sure, but none that seemed to focus on a single point. He sat up slowly, wincing and reaching around to feel the back of his head. There was a large bump back there and just the slightest bit of stickiness. He took his hand away and had to bring his fingers close to his eyes in the darkness in order to see that there was indeed blood.

When he realized he was still somehow alive, he was instantly flooded with dread. It stung him like a million little bees and he could feel it in the sky, as if weighing it down to drop right on his head. He looked up to the banks of the ravine, sure that the creature he’d seen would still be there. Perhaps its long, talon-like fingers would still be dripping with Kelly’s blood as it taunted him.

But even in the absolute darkness, he could see that there was nothing up there. In fact, he started to notice that despite the overhang of towering trees and stunning darkness of the Alaskan night, seeing out here wasn’t all that difficult. First of all, there was practically no light pollution at all, so the shining stars and crescent moon that shone down did their job effectively. Toss in the thin white sheet of snow that had fallen earlier in the day, and it all added to a very slight but effective natural light. It was an eerie way to see for sure, but it was much better than being stranded in pitch black.

Gratefully taking this blessing, he got to his feet. His head reeled and swayed a moment, but he blinked it away and managed to center himself. He nearly started walking ahead right away, but then remembered the rifle. He could see it to his left, lying on rocks and the thin strip of sand and grime that bordered the frozen creek. It gleamed dully in the dark, like a snake. Upon picking it up, the heft of it surprised him. Had it felt this heavy before? He didn’t think so, and it made him wonder just how badly he’d hurt his head in the fall.

Instinct told him to run because there was some ungodly monster out in the woods. But his aching head insisted that he take it nice and easy for a while. Chris meandered on through the ravine, keeping his eyes to the embankments not only for any signs of movement, but also for dips in the terrain that would allow him to easily crawl out. He figured he probably could get out whenever he wanted. He could scale the slanted ground, use roots and rocks to leverage himself, but he still didn’t quite trust his balance yet. Idly, he wondered how long he’d been knocked out. He didn’t wear a watch and though his phone was in his pack, he—

“Damn,” he said, realizing there was no pack on his back. He’d taken it off back where Kelly had been and when he went running away from the monster, he’d left it behind. Strangely, this really didn’t bother him all that much. Based on what he’d seen of the thing that had killed Kelly, there was nothing at all in that pack that would help him.

As he made his way through the ravine, he did his best to not let his mind slip into an area that, to him, felt too much like lunacy. But the shapes and movements he’d seen from the monster told him enough. It had not been a bear and it sure as hell had not been a deer. Not a wolf, or a coyote, or any other animal that might live out in these woods. It brought to mind things Jay had told them, and then Kelly. They had mentioned two things that he’d initially passed off a nonsense but now seemed to make sense.

Yupik spirits. The Wendigo.

He was pretty sure he’d heard of the Wendigo before, but he didn’t know where. And he certainly knew nothing about it. His frazzled brain thought it might be something like Bigfoot, but not nearly as popular…maybe a little more mystical. Something to do with the spirit of the forest or something.

Spirit, monster, whatever it was, all Chris knew was that it had a head that sat lopsided on its shoulders. It also had impossibly long arms that ended in hands like claws, with impossible strength. The sound of Kelly’s head popping was far too fresh in his mind, and it seemed to make his own head hurt even worse. So, he did his best to push it all away, focusing instead on the embankment to his left. He ignored the one to his right because he knew that was not the way they had been coming when they’d found Kelly. He was pretty sure going that way would eventually lead him to Maupin Lake. There might be a few trails back in that direction, but if that was the case, he’d have no solid idea of where they went or what direction he’d need to go.

He walked on, his footfalls sounding impossibly loud in the otherwise quiet night. In the back of his mind, he wondered if running away might have been a mistake. If Bear, Noah, and Bobby came back to find him, they’d find nothing but the gruesome remains of Kelly.

And maybe a legendary creature of the woods.

Oh, that’s just sad, part of him thought. You know something went wrong with them, right? You felt it as soon as night fell. Even before you saw that unnamable thing on the banks, you knew something was wrong. You know they’re dead, right?

Based on how Kelly had died and what had done it… yes, he thought there was a very good chance they were all dead. But he wasn’t. And as selfish as it made him feel, he had to focus on that for now.

The determination of it seemed to unclutter his mind a bit more. While the pain was still there, like a jagged electric ball in the back of his skull, he felt more at ease. The rifle in his hands no longer felt heavy and his legs were more stable. To the left, the embankment dropped only slightly, but he saw an outcropping of several rocks that protruded almost the entire way up. Many were small and barely there at all, but it would do. Glancing once more to make sure there were no lurking figures in the darkness, Chris headed for the embankment. He realized at once that he was going to have to toss the rifle to the top before climbing. It had no strap, he was going to need both hands to scale the embankment.

Not liking the idea at all, he heaved the rifle to the flat ground overhead. It landed with a soft clatter and Chris instantly felt naked. He approached the sloppy outcropping of rock and found that the first three were almost as neatly spaced as a staircase. After that, though, it became more like a rickety ladder with an almost vertical ascent. He only lost his footing once, but he easily caught himself on another, larger rock just to his left. When he neared the top, his right hand grabbed the level ground and his left grabbed a root that had broken through the dirt.

He heaved himself up and crawled out of the ravine.

Back on the flat forest floor, Chris wasted no time. He picked up the rifle, got to his feet, and looked ahead. For a moment, without the ravine walls there to pin him in, he almost felt free. But then he saw all the trees and felt how they sort of leaned into him, like a cage. They all worked together to look like an abstract wall in some places and like an impossible maze in others. For one insane moment, he thought it might all be shifting—moving just the slightest bit as if the entire forest was adjusting to his presence.

He thought of simply screaming, of yelling out for Bear, Noah, or even Bobby. But that seemed very dangerous. If the wendigo (if that’s what it really was) was actually out there somewhere and didn’t know where he was, screaming would sure as hell clue it in.

More naïve thinking, that deadened part of him said. You think something like that doesn’t know where you are, and what you’re doing? It’s messing with you. It’s teasing you.

Chris felt that this was likely true. But it raised a good question: Why?

He supposed the creature—be it a natural predator of the forest of a spiritual force out of Native American lore—could simply be toying with him. Maybe it was hunting him, making a sport out of chasing him and the others down. Maybe that’s why it had allowed Kelly to get away after killing her fiancé. The display it had made of her fiancé, gutted and strung from a tree, indicated that it was indeed having some sort of fun by chasing and tormenting him.

It made Chris wonder just how much longer the thing would wait to kill him. When would it get tired of the hunt and throw him up in a tree, mauled and bloodied?

The thought of it put more speed into Chris’s step. He figured the road had to be somewhere close by. Maybe another seven to ten minutes of walking would get him there if his memory served correctly. But in the darkness, the size of the forest and the sheer number of trees made the idea of any sort of road impossible. He didn’t think the place had seemed this impenetrable earlier in the day. Maybe it was just the effect of shadows and darkness with the night sinking in between each and every single one of the trees like spilled ink.

As he pressed on, he found himself thinking of Vicki and Brianna. He tried to think of the house, of his bedroom, of his bed. Somewhere else in the world, those things existed. And though the idea of Vicki made him furious, he also thought of the warmth of her body when she would come to bed. She’d never been one to wear much of anything to bed, going totally nude on late spring and summer nights. He thought of the warmth of her hand as it reached out in the dark for him. It hadn’t happened often, but those were the moments he remembered more than anything. That sort of warmth seemed impossible out in these forests and that sort of closeness with another human was a distant memory while trapped among the trees and thin sheet of snow.

Then there was Brianna. The idea of her made no sense out here. She was hope and light and all things right. It was a stark contrast to the woods, the cold, and what he had experienced in the past twenty hours or so hours. He could not manage to accept the fact that his smiling daughter could exist in the same world where mythical creatures popped women’s heads like grapes and strung men into trees by their insides as if they were kites that had been taken by the wind.

Still, he kept his thoughts on Brianna. If he made it out of this, she was all he had left. Vicki and Bobby could do whatever they wanted. He didn’t need to know the juicy details or what their lives would look like afterwards. He just wanted Vicki gone, Bobby out of his life, and a fresh start with his daughter.

The thought of it urged him on.

His feet crunched against the thin sheet of frozen snow and he gripped the rifle tightly.

Brianna.

He’d make it out of this to get home to Brianna. He kept her face in his mind as if she was a lighthouse somewhere in this damnable darkness, pulling him back towards the road.`,

      content: `When they came to the fork in the trail, Bear and Bobby stopped for a moment. Bear was pretty sure Bobby had been crying—either that or muttering some sort of sad words of meager encouragement to himself. He’d caught a few bits of it here and there and wondered if his friend might be losing his mind. But now, standing at the fork in the trail, Bobby’s muttering had stopped. He looked back at Bear with a hopeful expression on his face. It was the most hope he’d seen out of anyone ever since they’d woken up yesterday morning and found half of a fox shoved under the hood of their SUV.

“You know which way to go?” Bobby asked.

For the briefest of seconds, Bear wanted to punch Bobby again. He wanted tell Bobby that if he hadn’t been such an immature child, pouting and pounding beer on the way to the cabin, maybe he would have noticed the turns they’d taken. He pushed the urge away, though. It would do nothing but make things harder.

“We veer to the left. And if I’m not mistaken, the rescue station is on this road. If it is where Noah thought, he saw it. We’re close now.”

A faint sort of clarity crossed Bobby’s face. It made the pale color of his skin (aside from the bright red of his cheeks and nose, thanks to the cold) look a little less ghastly. He stepped aside, non-verbally communicating that he wanted Bear to lead the way. Bear did so without complaint, again having to hide his irritation.

It surprised Bear just how much more confident he felt now that they were on the trail. While the trees were still looming on all sides, a reminder of the madness they’d experienced earlier, there was something about being properly guided that helped diminish the fear.

It did raise a question, though, and it was one he tried not to dwell on even though it was right at the corner of his mind, poking and prodding. That question was: “How did we manage to all of a sudden find the trail?”

Several times while in the forest, he’d gotten the sense that the lay of the land had somehow changed—not that they had gotten turned around, but that the woods had come to life and moved. Now that they were on the trail, he didn’t feel that anymore. And it made him wonder… if there was some sort of paranormal trickery at play, why had they been allowed to finally leave the trees?

There was insanity waiting near the end of that train of thought, so he left it alone. Instead, he simply walked, his eyes almost aching now from the constant glare of the thin layer of white snow against the sheer darkness of night. He kept telling himself the rescue station was right around the corner, beyond the next grove of trees, somewhere at the other end of the trail. He had to tell himself that because as his knees trembled with each step and the cold now seemed to have found his heart and slowly curl around it, the prospect of giving up was far too appealing.

---

They’d been on the trail for fifty minutes when the perfectly square shape came into view. It was just beyond a little grove of trees that clung tightly together, as if trying to hide the building. Bear stared at it hard, trying to make absolutely sure it wasn’t some sort of mirage. But no…the walls were there, the slant of the roof, even the slight glint of glass from a window.

It was the rescue station. Bear glanced at his watch and saw that it was 3:37 in the morning. He wasn’t sure just how accurate the watch was, but he was fine assuming it was correct. They’d gotten here about ten hours later than he’d hoped, but somehow, they’d finally made it. They were down two men and he thought his mind might never recover from the absolute nightmare they’d experienced in the forest…but they’d made it.

The station really wasn’t much more than a shack, though a sturdy and well-built one. There was no welcoming porch, no room for decoration or embellishments; it was a perfectly rectangular building made of concrete, brick, and wood. The single window of the place stood out on the side, facing them. Seeing it, both of them went running forward with renewed energy.

As they cleared the trees and came to the building, Bear realized that in his excitement of seeing the place, he’d somehow not noticed that there were no vehicles anywhere around it. He’d assumed that a rescue station out in the middle of nowhere would be staffed around the clock, but that had apparently been a false assumption. There were no vehicles, and no lights on inside the station. He felt his hope starting to falter but then pulled it right back up.

So, what if no one was there? They’d break in and use the phone. And if an alarm went off when they broke in, so what? Let the cops come. It would be a welcome arrival.

Two little concrete rectangles led up to the door. As Bear climbed then, Bobby seemed to come to the same realization. “Despite my shady past,” he said, “I’ve never actually broken into a building.”

“Me neither. But there’s a first time for everything.”

Because he figured he may as well give it a go, Bear tried the front door and was not surprised to find it locked. The door was quite solid and when he pushed against it and then kicked it, he knew they’d have problems getting through it. If they’d kept the rifle, they’d just blast the knob and lock off. But alas, there was no rifle.

“Let’s check around back,” Bobby said.

They hurried in that direction, Bobby finally taking the lead for once. They hurried around the back so fast that Bobby skidded on a bit of ice at the corner along the rear of the building and nearly went sprawling. When he did right himself, he came to a stop, looking dead ahead. Bear saw what he had spotted right away and that surge of hope he’d felt upon seeing the building intensified.

There was a small shed attached to the rear right corner of the building. It was little more than a sloppy little carport sort of attachment, with a corrugated tin roof held up on steel poles, bolted to the back of the station. The canopy was covering two ATVs—four wheelers that looked like they had been through the ringer. They were chained together at the handlebars to prevent anyone from stealing them. Sitting at the far corner of the shelter, there was a large gas cannister. There was also a snow mobile, but it was on a small mechanical lift and would be useless.

“Well, we’re breaking in anyway,” Bobby said. “Adding grand theft auto to the list of charges isn’t so much worse, right?”

“I don’t think it’s going to come to that. If I can place a call from inside, I think the best bet is to stay right here until help comes.”

“I’d agree if there wasn’t some sort of monster on our heels.”

Bear ignored the comment and looked to the outside of the little shelter. The back door to the building was much smaller than the front. There were scuffs and chips in the door frame, indicating that this was the door that things were were moved in and out of—desks, furniture, and so on. And while the front door had looked modern and almost industrial, the back door was clearly made of wood. It had a basic turning knob, which made Bear assume the lock wasn’t made of anything special, like the one up front. He again tried the knob before resorting to anything drastic, but it was locked.

He took a step away from the door and then took that step right back with force. He threw his shoulder into the door and though it did not give way, the amount of give it afforded provided a better idea of how strong it was—and it wasn’t very strong at all.

He almost asked Bobby to give him a hand, but he could see that Bobby was now looking out of the canopy, back out into the woods. He was scared, making sure they weren’t being followed by that…that thing. It made Bear feel at least a bit more comfortable to know that Bobby was serving as lookout, so he left him alone. If that unnamable thing showed up…

Ah, but you know what it is, Bear thought as he threw his shoulder into the door again. Something inside the station cracked, and he heard little groaning noises from within the door. Your pilot told you what it was. You just don’t want to believe it.

This was true, but he would not allow the thought to take traction. Instead, he focused on the fear and frustration of what that thought might mean into his next attack on the door. He slammed his shoulder into it again. The frame cracked and split, but the door held steady. Frustrated now, he delivered a brutal kick—a kick so hard that when it connected, it not only tore the door down, but sent him falling absurdly into the station.

When he hit the floor, a chunk of the door was resting beneath him. He was pretty sure he’d pulled something high up along his thigh with the kick and subsequent fall, but that was the least of his worries. He scrambled to his feet, aware of the total absence of an alarm. Apparently, the place had no sort of security system. He looked back out through the doorframe and saw Bobby still looking out at the woods. Hey was now also leaning against one of the ATVs and if Bear was being totally honest with himself, the idea of hopping on one of them and getting back to Birch seemed like a pretty good idea. That, or they could ride back out towards the cabin and hope to find Chris. He figured getting actual help would be the safest bet, but it was hard to just sit on hope while their friend was still out there.

What if he’s in no better shape than Noah? He wondered. Chances are pretty good that thing got him, too…rifle or no rifle.

This thought broke him out of his little trance. He quickly took stock of the building. It was split into two areas: the back portion, which looked like a small bullpen out of a police drama on TV, and the front area, which allowed just enough room for a visitor to come in. The little bullpen-like area contained one large desk and two smaller ones. One of the small ones held a laptop and an old coffee cup. The larger one was adorned with a desk calendar, several memo pads, an in-and-out paper tray and, glory of glories, an actual honest to God telephone. It was the sort that was used in the main office at Bear’s school—an old school model with a cradle, a receiver, and a black twirled cord attaching the two.

He ran for the phone, and his hand instantly went to the receiver. When he touched it, his eyes fell on something else. Perched on the wall on a rack and in an almost funny sort of display, was a shotgun. He thought it was just a strange decoration at first, but the way the stock was well worn and scratched, the barrel a little dirty, he realized it was the real thing. Someone had taped a sheet of paper beneath it with two words scrawled on it: BEAR REPELLANT. It was surely meant to be someone’s idea of a joke but as Bear looked at it, he wasn’t laughing at all.

He wanted to take it down, to have something to carry back out with them while they waited for help. Hell, he might just take it down anyway… maybe scrounge around to see if there were any shells.

Just below the shotgun and to the right, beside an old, battered filing cabinet, he saw something else of interest. A single hook hung from the wall. A set of keys were hanging from the hook with three keys in all. Two looked identical, and the other was quite different. It didn’t take stellar deductive reasoning to assume that these were the keys to the ATVs and the lock that held them together. Impulsively, he grabbed the keys. The more he thought about it, the more he wanted to get on those four wheelers and get out of here. Even if the police could be here in just five or ten minutes, he simply did not feel safe walking through the woods.

He pocketed the keys, eyed the shotgun one more time, and then turned back to the phone. He reached for the receiver again and his hand had just barely grazed it when Bobby started screaming his name outside.

Bear jumped, his heart feeing like it was trying to crawl out of his throat. He gripped the receiver but then heard Bobby scream again. This time, there were words, not just a distressed sound. And those words were just about the most terrifying he’d ever heard.

“It’s here!” Bobby screamed, nearly shrieking. “Bear, hurry up, it’s right here!”

Forgetting the phone completely, Bear instead took the shotgun down from the wall. He snapped it open, saw that it was indeed loaded and ready to go. He then ran to the back of the building, nearly skidding on the door he’d knocked down less than thirty seconds ago. The moment he stepped outside, Bobby stopped screaming. He was still by the ATVs, but was no longer looking out into the forests.

Bear followed the direction of his gaze and while he did see a shape moving out there, he was more horrified of what he saw come hurtling out of the trees.

At first, he thought the creature had chucked some large boulder at them. But then the projectile hit the ground right in front of Bobby’s feet and it caused him to jump back, letting out a screamed curse and falling flat on his backside. Bear thought of the top portion of the fox from earlier, and how it had been chucked at them from somewhere in the forest. For just a second, that’s what he saw, his terrified mind projecting the image.

But what rested at their feet this time was infinitely worse.

Bear brought up the shotgun as he came to Bobby’s side. He glanced to the ground and clearly saw what had been thrown at them. He felt his mind slipping into what he assumed was some sort of madness as he studied this new, grisly gift.

It was Noah’s head, his mouth agape and his dead eyes wide with terror. His neck had been torn directly from his torso; his trachea was visible, hanging out of the torn skin and muscle.

“No, no, no…” Bear said. He was trembling, and his stomach lurched.

His eyes went back to the tree line. The much larger shape came slowly out of the scraggly trees, finally making itself known. Bear kept holding the shotgun up, but it appeared that every bit of his mind was focused on making sense of what he was seeing. It did not even occur to him in those initial moments to pull the trigger.

He now understood why his fleeting glimpse of the thing earlier had not made any sense. The creature, which looked remarkably human, was easily seven feet tall. Despite the height, it also looked gaunt and emaciated. Its arms looked far too long, the hands little more than a collection of five skeletal fingers and claws. A few of them were dark and twisted, resembling thin tree branches. It regarded them with small eyes; the eyes were the only thing on its body that seemed to be remotely human. Because they were so normal, they looked terrifying in contrast to the rest of it. From what Bear could see, it appeared to have no sex or, if it did, it was somehow concealed.

“Bear, what the hell is that?” Bobby asked, slowly getting to his feet. His voice was high and urgent, nearing a panicked shout.

Bear had no idea, so he didn’t answer. Though, in the back of his head, one of the words Jay had used rang clear as a bell for a moment.

Wendigo.

Bracing the shotgun between his right arm and right side, Bear slipped his left hand into his pocket. He moved slowly, not wanting to startle the monstrous thing in front of them. It was still approaching, though its steps seemed slow and calculated. In the thin darkness of a night that was about to give way to dawn, its movements looked almost erratic and jerky. Bear’s fingers found the keys from inside and slowly pulled them out.

“Bobby…take these. Free up those four wheelers and…”

The Wendigo let out a scream.

It was high-pitched but had a sort of ragged dryness to it. The sound of it was almost as horrifying as the sight of it. The creature’s jaw seemed to come unhinged, almost like a snake. Its chipped and greyed teeth seemed to tremble with the force of the scream. Its tongue hung from the side if its mouth as something like splinters of wood fell from its lips.

And then it came for them. Its legs, barely thicker than its arms, moved in an almost ape-like way. But it was moving fast, that scream of rage still coming from its unhinged jaws.

Working on nothing but pure fear and adrenaline, Bear tossed the keys to Bobby. He didn’t take the time to see if Bobby caught them or what happened afterwards. Instead, he did his best to trace the movements of the Wendigo and fired a shot, reminding himself that he only had two.

The shot landed true, taking the monster high on its side. It stuttered back a bit, going down to a knee. The scream fell dead in its throat. Bear could see blood coming out of its body and now that it was down, it took great restraint not to blast the second shot into it. But he knew it could be a wasted shot; he had no idea how the thing would react to the injury. He had to save the last shot for a moment when he knew it could potentially kill the thing. And walking right up to it to deliver a headshot seemed very ill-advised.

Behind him, he heard Bobby muttering a string of curses as he fought with the keys and chains around the ATVs. He sounded panicked and close to going utterly over the edge.

Looking at the sight in front of them, Bear now felt that waiting for help (even if he had managed to make the phone call) would be a fool’s errand. If they were going to get out of this alive, the four wheelers were their only hope.

But as it turned out, it seemed it was a decision he would have to make sooner rather than later. After a simple stumble, the wendigo regained its posture, narrowed its small eyes at them and roared.

It bared down and came rushing forward as Bear waited for the right moment to fire. The look of rage and fury on its deformed face made every single thing inside of Bear go cold—a cold that obliterated the chill of the wilderness that had been assaulting them for the last day or so.

“Got it!” Bobby yelled from behind him.

Bear turned to the sight of Bobby climbing onto one of the four wheelers, the chains falling to the ground. Bobby was jamming a key into the ignition at about the same time Bear turned back around and saw the wendigo right there, somehow already right in his face.

He tried to squeeze the trigger to get the last shot off from the shotgun, but somehow, the gun was no longer there. The monster had slapped it out of his hand as if swatting at a fly.

His hand clutched for a gun that was no longer there and his mind tried its best to catch up to how fast things were moving. As a result, the creature was on him before he had any actual idea of what was happening.`,

      content: `The trees felt very much like a maze, only it was a maze in which you were a little terrified to make any specific turn—a maze where you needed to stay on a straight path because any turn you took would certainly lead you to some other maze or, worse yet, to the start of this one all over again. So rather than keeping his eyes on the dark shapes of the trees in the pre-dawn darkness, Chris instead concentrated on the ground in front of him. He looked to the frozen-over snow and focused on putting one foot in front of the other, in front of the other, in front of the other.

The snow made him think of Briana. He wondered how she’d feel about the snow. She was the sort of little girl that loved to be outside, but then again, outside in Sacramento, California meant something totally different than it did here in the wilderness of Alaska. He wondered how she would handle the cold. She’d probably hate it, but would come around pretty quickly if there was a sled or some nice packable snow that she could make snowballs out of. He felt rather sad knowing that she may never experience snow during her childhood. He’d never really made plans to take her anywhere where there was snow. And he knew if he didn’t make it out of this alive, she probably never would. Vicki, while a very loving and supportive mother, had never really been one to nurture play or creativity.

It seemed like a flimsy motivation to make it out of this alive…to make sure Brianna was able to enjoy the sight and feel of snow before she got too old to truly appreciate it. Chris had grown up just outside of Boulder, Colorado, not moving to California until his college years. He’d known snow and skiing most of his childhood which, he supposed, was why he hadn’t ever thought it was that big of a deal.

He kept thoughts of Brianna front and center. She would be why he made it out of this. While survival itself was enough of a reason, it was a selfish reason. He would get back home so he could be a good father for his daughter, so he could be there for her when the marriage of her parents dissolved. Because while he hated the idea of Brianna being traumatized by their divorce, he also knew there was no way he’d ever forgive Vicki.

Thinking of Vicki made him wonder where Bear, Noah, and Bobby had ended up. It was easy to assume they’d been killed by what Chris was now admitting to himself was indeed a wendigo. But he also knew how resourceful and determined Bear could be. It was enough for Chris to hold on to at least some form of hope—a hope that at least Bear might still be alive out there, that they—

A loud cracking sound coming from out of the forest broke Chris’s thoughts apart. It was a sound he knew, but had not heard often. The forest, in its weird and dark design, seemed to twist and distort the sound. Still, it was quite apparent what the sound was: a gunshot.

And it was not a small, contained shot, either. It wasn’t the sort of noise he’d expect to hear from a pistol or even the rifle he was currently carrying. No, this had been a large, booming noise. Even now, two seconds after he’d heard it, it continued to echo in the darkened silence.

The sound of it made Chris halt and raise the rifle, ready to shoot anything that might come wandering through the trees.

Let’s not be stupid, he told himself. There’s a good chance that was one of your friends. Maybe they found help. Maybe that help is currently in some kind of trouble.

Chris wasn’t sure if any of that was true. All he knew was that the sound seemed to be relatively close by and it indicated that there was someone alive to shoot the gun that made the sound within hearing distance. For now, that was enough for Chris. He drew in a deep breath, made quite difficult by the cold, and started running. He continued to keep his eyes low, just high enough to know when to bob and weave so he would not collide with every tree in front of him.

The noise of his boots crushing the snow was like an odd music and he kept the beat in his head as his feet moved quickly forward. He kept the rifle trained ahead, fully aware that the monster could be lurking along at his side and he’d never even know it.

Chris wasn’t sure how long he ran. He had the vague feeling that it had not been very long. What he did know was that the slight rise in the land had levelled out and he thought that meant the trail might be very close by.

“Thank you, God,” he said in a raspy intake of breath.

His lungs were on fire from the cold air he’d pushed in and out and his legs were nothing but knots of pain. But he ran on in the direction he thought the trail was located, becoming aware of the soft colors of dawn scratching their way into the horizon through the trees.

It was easier to hope he was close to the trail thanks to the slow approach of the sun. It was slowly on its way to break the night apart. For a moment, all seemed promising and hopeful. It was enough to keep him motivated, to think he might get out of this alive after all.

But then he heard the screaming and a roar like nothing he’d ever heard before, and his knees seemed to turn to jelly. Still, he ran, hoping he might be able to lend a hand to whatever trouble was taking place further up the trail. Maybe they were all still alive. Maybe they were indeed going to get out of this nightmare together.

Rifle at the ready and with fear wrapping around his heart like barbed wire, Chris kept running because it was all he could think to do.`,

      content: `Bobby had the key in the ignition of the four wheeler, his hand still on the clasp at the top of the key. For a sickening moment, he nearly turned it. He could crank it and haul ass away from here, leaving Bear to occupy the monster while he escaped. In the back of his mind, he tried to convince himself that maybe Bear could get away from the thing and hide out in the woods somewhere while Bobby went for help. But every other part of Bobby’s mind knew that this was a lie. The simple fact of the matter was that Bobby was fully prepared to leave behind a man he considered a friend—leave him to die so that he, Bobby, could get away.

The temptation was strong, and his fingers ached to turn the key and press the starter. But, as wretched as he was in certain other areas of his life, there was no way he could do that.

Even now, as Bobby forced himself to step down off of the ATV, the wendigo was throwing Bear to the ground. It reared back on its spindly legs and growled. The noise had the tone of being half-human and half-animal. Bobby had no problem assuming that if the thing wanted to, it could speak. But there was a wildness in its eyes that made him think it was beyond speech; it was only interested in roaring and killing, striking terror into anything that dared to get in its way.

As Bobby tried to think of some way to halt the best (aside from simply screaming right back at it), he watched as it brought one of its large, claw-tipped hands down in a slashing motion. It caught Bear right across the left forearm, tearing through his coat and causing an instant spray of blood. Bobby looked around furiously, trying to find something to use as a weapon. There was the shotgun, but that was to the left and directly behind the monster, so that was out of the question.

The best he could find was an old axe that was propped in the corner of the little car port, stacked alongside an old crowbar, several pieces of scrap metal and wood, and a large hoe. Bobby ran for the axe and when he lifted, realized it was not an axe but more like a maul. He figured it was some sort of tool used to pry open wrecked car doors. He hefted it, a little surprised at the weight, and ran for the wendigo.

The creature caught sight of Bobby just as he was bringing the maul around in a wide arc. It stopped bringing its other claw down on Bear and turned towards Bobby. The maul struck the beast low on its side, not too far away from where Bear had shot it. It felt like striking a scarecrow. Bobby wasn’t sure, but he thought he could feel things crunching under the weight of his blow, but also something that felt almost like putty. Whatever this thing was, it did not seem to be made of much at all.

The creature took one staggered and surprised step backwards, its small spiteful eyes turning in Bobby’s direction. It didn’t forget about Bear, as it swatted at him with its right arm in an almost nonchalant sort of waving of its odd hand. Bear managed to duck away, falling to the ground and holding his injured arm to his chest.

As the monster took a large stride toward Bobby, he took another swing with the maul. He put everything he had into it, his shoulders tight and his forearms carrying the weight and force of it. And in the end, the blow went wide. He missed the creature by about three inches as it hesitated, seeing the attack coming.

The force of the swing sent Bobby around in a half-circle. He thought it might have actually looked funny if there hadn’t been a monster right in front of him. It was like some overzealous kid swinging for the fences at a little league gaming, missing the ball completely, and nearly falling on his ass. But the wendigo’s reaction to this was not amusement, but anger. It reached out with one of its waifish arms and grabbed Bobby by the shoulder. When it fell on him and grasped, Bobby felt just how brittle it was—yet, at the same time, there was an underlying strength he felt the moment it clutched his shoulder.

In a dizzying handful of seconds, Bobby realized that he was being lifted from the ground. By the time he sensed his feet were off the ground, he then felt himself propelled forward, sailing through empty space.

At about the same time Bobby realized he had been thrown, something slammed hard into his back. He assumed it was a tree, as he could hear the skeletal noises of the branches overhead, snow falling down from the impact. He also felt and heard something pop in his back. It was an odd sensation because while there was a jarring stab of pain high in his back; it was followed by a surprisingly pleasing sensation, as if something had loosened up back there. He had no time to dwell on this, though, because as soon as all of this registered, he was hitting the ground.

Bobby was dizzy for a moment, trying to understand what the hell had just happened in the last two or three seconds. He staggered to his knees and tried getting to his feet. When he did so, a stinging pain blared through his back, right where he’d felt the pop when he struck the tree. The pain took his breath away for a moment, but then it passed. By the time he was able to move forward again, the wendigo had returned its attention back to Bear. Bear was going for the shotgun again, but just before his hand fell on the barrel, the wendigo’s hands were on him. This time, it picked him Bear from the ground as if he was nothing more than a crawling toddler.

Bear shouted out in pain, a sound Bobby never thought he’d hear from the huge man’s mouth. He didn’t understand why Bear was screaming at first, but then he saw that the wendigo was bending him in what was almost a U-shape. There was a loud, sharp cracking noise as something broke inside of Bear. He screamed again and this time the wendigo pulled harder. Bobby could see and hear when Bear’s left leg popped out of socket. It hung limply, like plastic.

Bobby screamed, the sound coming out in a panicked and nearly tearful whine. He tried to make a run toward the monster, but his injured back locked up and a blinding pain went spiraling through him. Maybe he’d broken or dislocated something in his back. Maybe being slammed against the tree had—

Suddenly, Bear’s screams came to an abrupt stop. They were replaced by a wet, gnashing sound that, sickly enough, reminded Bobby of someone biting into a particularly juicy and ripe apple. Despite the pain seizing his back, Bobby was able to slowly back away from what he saw. The sound was coming from the wendigo, burying its maw into Bear’s stomach. Blood and gore came running down Bear’s sides in thick globs of dark red and pink. He was shuddering in the thing’s grip, his broken leg still dangling uselessly as little grunts and weak protests escaped his throat.

The sight of it did two things at once: first, it helped Bobby look beyond the pain in his back; second, it clued him into the idea that in about one minute’s time, that could be him—that could be him being eaten alive, chewed into like nothing more than a chicken wing. Using every bit of courage, he could muster up from the already dried up depths of his heart, Bobby grabbed the maul once more. As the wendigo continued to feed, Bobby drew the weapon back and slammed its heavy end directly into the monster’s stomach. Bobby’s back roared in agony and he nearly fell over from the pain.

The impact of Bobby’s attack was massive, causing shockwaves of impact to course up his arms. Bits of gore and blood rained down as the monster quickly moved its snack. Knowing where the mess was coming from, Bobby uttered a shriek and fought back what he was sure was going to be quite a display of vomiting.

The wendigo staggered back from the attack, nearly dropping Bear. In its distraction, Bobby made a quick dash for the shotgun, grabbed it up while letting go of the maul. He then circled back as the beast whirled around, looking for him. Shotgun in hand, Bobby sprinted back to the carport, having to hobble a bit from whatever was wrong with his back. As he moved, he looked back to Bear. He saw his friend’s lifeless eyes, his mouth forever frozen open in a scream that had never been voiced. From its too-wide mouth as he made a direct line back to the little car port. He jumped onto the four-wheeler, his back now screaming in pain but with buckets of adrenaline essentially drowning it out. His trembling right hand found the key in the ignition, right where he had left it, while his left clung to the shotgun.

He had to lay the shotgun across his lap to thumb the starter and turn the key, and the gun nearly slid off. The engine kicked to life and Bobby grabbed for the shotgun. He found the gear shift at his right foot, revved the engine, and kicked it into first gear. The four-wheeler lurched forward just as the wendigo came charging at the little canopy. The damned thing was so tall that even when it ducked down to come in after Bobby, the top of its misshapen head struck the roof. And as Bobby kicked the four wheeler into second gear, he was pretty sure that one momentary goof on the wendigo’s part had saved his life.

Even through the roar of the four wheeler’s engine, he could hear the monster screaming in frustration. The cold wind whipped at his face as he brought the four-wheeler around the side of the rescue station and for a terrifying moment, he thought the trail would somehow not be there. But sure enough, it was there, clearly etched out in the slowly gathering light of dawn. He had to turn slowly onto it because he only had one hand to drive with, the other gripping the shotgun. He dared a single look behind him and though he saw the wendigo coming for him, he could already tell that there wouldn’t be much of a chase. It might be vicious and blood-thirsty, but it didn’t quite have the speed to keep up with a four wheeler being pushed to its limit.

Bobby hit the trail and kicked the ATV into fourth fear. He felt it trying to stall out but let off of the gas for a moment, then hit it again. The engine regained its composure, and he sped on, oblivious to the wind cutting at him like a knife. He drove on, not wanting to look behind him, not wanting to see that thing chasing him if it was indeed giving chase.

But when he heard a voice screaming for help several seconds later, he had no choice but to turn his head.

“Bear?” he asked, finding it hard to believe.

He slowed a bit, taking a moment to understand what he was seeing.

No, it wasn’t Bear.

Chris had come out of the woods, panting and exhausted.

He extended a hand for help as he fell to the ground. Once again, Bobby found himself nearly running away from one of the few men he’d ever been able to truly consider a friend.

In a blinding moment of clarity, Bobby proved to himself that perhaps he wasn’t as hopeless as he and everyone else thought. With a heavy heart and fear raging in his stomach, Bobby slowed the four-wheeler, downshifted to neutral and hopped off. He ran to Chris but never took his eyes off of the trail. He knew he was no more than half a mile or so away from the station, and he had no idea just how fast the monster on his heels might be.`,

      content: `When Chris heard the sound of an engine nearby, he’d taken off running. He ran at an angle, hoping to cut off the driver before it could reach peak speed. To his surprise, he came out along the edge of the forest, falling down right along the meager road. The rifle clattered to the ground, and he reached out for it blindly. He looked up and to his left, catching sight of the four-wheeler. It was a blurry shape and he could not tell how many men were on it as he heaved for air. He sucked in as much as he could, his lungs feelings like they were crumbling inside of him, and screamed.

“Help!”

The engine noise receded almost right away and he watched as the driver turned to face him. Though his vision was hazy and he was finding it hard to breathe, Chris saw that the driver was Bobby. And in seeing his face, Chris felt suddenly certain that he was going to die. What reason did Bobby have to stop and pick him up after everything that had transpired the last few days?

Yet to his surprise, the four-wheeler came to a stop and there was only a moment of hesitation as Bobby came running for him. Chris noticed that Bobby did not look at him a single time as he came forward. His eyes were looking back behind them, as if he expected to see something.

“You hurt?” Bobby asked as he got to Chris.

“No. Just…hard to…breathe.”

“Got any rounds left in that rifle?”

“Don’t know. Left the box in my pack…”

“Good enough for me,” Bobby said, pushing an arm under Chris’s arm pit. “Let’s get moving. There’s something back there and—”

“I know. Saw it. Let’s…go.”

Bobby hefted Chris up and helped him make it to the four-wheeler. Chris saw that there was a shotgun on the seat. He wondered what sort of hell Bobby had lived through. Sadly, he assumed Bear and Noah’s fates were clear so he didn’t waste his breath or energy asking. Not yet, not now. He also wondered if the splatters of blood on Bobby’s face were his own or if they’d come from somewhere (or someone) else.

“Can you hold on to that and yours?” Bobby asked, nodding to the shotgun.

Chris nodded, picking the gun up as he sat behind Bobby.

“Good. If that bastard catches up with us, at least we’ll have some kind of fighting chance, I guess.”

When Bobby kicked the ATV back into gear, it gave a lurch forward. Chris held tight around Bobby’s midsection as Bobby let out a groan of pain. The four wheeler started rolling and Chris dared to think that they were actually going to get out of this.

“Are you hurt?” Chris asked.

“A bit.”

“Are Bear and Noah…?”

“Dead,” Bobby said as he kicked the ATV into another gear. “Something I can’t even describe. I think maybe one of those Yupik spirits or the—”

“The wendigo,” Chris said. There was not a bit of foolishness to the word. It felt factual and helped to drive home just how absolutely screwed they might be.

“Sorry we didn’t make it back to you,” Bobby said over the hum of the engine. “I swear it was like the forest was moving. Like it was alive. What about Kelly?”

“Dead,” Chris said, finally finding it a bit easier to draw in breath. “I didn’t think I’d be able to—”

He was interrupted as Bobby screamed out a curse and hit the brakes. Chris, still slightly hazy and out of sorts from his mad dash to the trail, didn’t quite catch sight of what happened. All he knew was that one moment they were driving along the trail with the wind slicing into his cheeks, and the next, it felt like he was flying. He hit the ground hard, but that wasn’t the end of it.

He hit, then bounced, then hit again. The last thing he was fully aware of before it was all over was the underside of the four-wheeler flipping over him, missing his head by no more than a foot.

And after that, Chris kept falling.

---

Bobby understood that there was probably some sort of universal karma to the fact that their little party was now down to two—to him and Chris. Given how Bobby had spent the last few months, sneaking around with Chris’s wife and then admitting to it when he was shitfaced drunk, it seemed almost fitting. He found himself wanting to apologize and beg for forgiveness, but he figured he could do all of that when they were off of this trail, sitting somewhere with central heat and a big tumbler or whiskey.

Instead, he kept his eyes on the trail. The wind felt like daggers in his eyes and he had to squint just to see. He did end up apologizing, only for something completely different.

“Sorry, we didn’t make it back to you. I swear it was like the forest was moving. Like it was alive. What about Kelly?”

“Dead.” Bobby could tell he was fighting to draw in a breath; it was like listening to a kid with asthma trying to talk after running a few laps. “I didn’t think I’d be able to—”

That’s when Bobby saw the hulking figure coming out of the woods to the left. Had he not already seen the wendigo, he might have assumed it was a massive bear, charging at the noise from the engine. But he knew what it was right away. It came through the trees and for a moment Bobby could swear that some of the larger trees actually seemed to be swaying and shifting to allow it easier access. He also realized that he had been wrong; moments ago, he was relieved to find that the wendigo wasn’t as fast as the ATV. But somehow, it had caught up to them and had enough speed to angle in on them.

He wondered, if only for a moment, if it moved like a ghost, coming and going and jumping over time and space as it pleased.

Instinctively, Bobby slammed on the brakes. The four-wheeler came to a halt just as the wendigo slammed into them. It made no attempt to reach for them or to grab them. It seemed to only want to cause damage, to kill them in the most reckless way it could. Bobby wasn’t sure what part of its body slammed into them. For a second, it looked like it was trying to throw a football-style block, tossing its shoulder into him and the four-wheeler.

Whatever it did, it worked. Bobby felt the four-wheeler tilt and lift off of the ground. He was instantly aware of Chris flying off of the back and then he was also no longer on the vehicle. Bobby went airborne for a moment and then, when he fell, felt the back wheel of the ATV slam into his shoulder. He then heard it clattering to the ground in a heap, but could not see where it had landed. He was too busy falling, then hitting the ground, then bouncing slightly and falling again. His back was a sheet of agony and his head was so dizzy that he was sure he’d broken his neck. He’d never felt such pain in his life.

The second time Bobby struck the ground, coming out of a half-flip, he saw the trail up above him, growing smaller and smaller. He then saw the severe angle of the ground he was on and managed to piece together what was happening. That thing had slammed into them and knocked them not only off of the trail, but down a steep hill, at that.

Bobby wasn’t sure how long he fell. It seemed like forever, but it was probably more like only five seconds. When he stopped, it was once again because of something slamming into his back. This time, he knew it was a slight outcropping of rock at the bottom of the hill. This time, the additional pain in his back was unmistakable. He felt something break, sending a wave of paralyzing pain through him as he screamed. Mid-scream, he looked up and saw that he had apparently fallen a little faster and a little smoother, than the four-wheeler.

The moment he saw it sliding down towards him, he knew what was going to happen. He could only close his eyes and brace for it as the four-wheeler took one last tumble and slammed hard into his chest. For just a moment, he felt a pain that dwarfed what he’d felt just a handful of seconds before. It was like being crushed and pulled apart on the inside all at the same time, things pinching and breaking and expanding all at once.

He gave himself over to that pain for just a moment, but that was all it took for the world to waver and sway before going absolutely black.`,

      content: `It was pure blind luck that Chris managed to stop his fall prematurely. He’d reached out, flailing like any man that fell down a steep hill, and his right hand managed to snag a sapling that was growing at an angle out of the hillside. He did his best to reach up with his left arm to get both hands on the sapling, but when he did that, the extra weight and pressure on the little tree caused it creak and bend.

Chris looked up and could not see the trail. The hill went down at what looked like a straight ninety-degree angle for a while and then became more severe. The point at which it fell away almost completely was where Chris currently found himself clinging to a thin and precarious little tree. He looked beneath his feet and saw that there was roughly another ten feet to drop. He also saw that Bobby had not been so lucky. He had landed squarely against the side of a rock outcropping and the four-wheeler had slammed into his chest.

Chris considered his options. He could either test the little sapling once more and try to climb up to the trail, or he could let go of the sapling, descend to Bobby as carefully as he could, and see what he could do to help. Neither option was very appealing, but even now, his little tree savior was continuing to bend and it looked like it was going to make the decision for him.

He kicked his foot out for some sort of hold along the hill. There was nothing there of help and the motion simply aggravated the little tree. He could see and hear it popping and cracking, its base no wider than the grip end of a baseball bat.

He cursed under his breath as the base snapped more and more.

It gave way just a few seconds later. Chris was ready for it and did his best to claw and kick at the slightly angled hillside. He did not fall blindly and could control his descent at least a little. Still, when he hit the bottom, the impact on his ankles and knees was harsh and he fell down on his back. The wind went rushing out of him as he looked up, fully expecting the wendigo to be looking down at them. But it wasn’t there…and the fact that he had no idea where it was made the situation even worse.

He understood, just as he’d hit the bottom, that it was the wendigo that had knocked the ATV off the trail. There was no way it had simply been reckless driving on Bobby’s part.

My God…Bobby…

Chris sat up, his back aching and his right arm singing in pain. There was also a sharp pinching sensation in his right side. He figured he’d cracked a rib or two on his way down but other than that, he seemed to be miraculously spared of any major injury. His head still ached dully from the fall he’d taken when he slipped on the ice, surely aggravated by this more recent tumble. But right now, none of it hurt too badly. However, he’d busted a rib before, playing hockey as a teenager. He knew that when he started moving; it was probably going to hurt like hell.

He got to his feet and scrambled over to Bobby. The pain in his ribs did intensify, and he had to stifle back a brief shout of pain. Given Bobby’s state, a little broken rib or two was nothing to be complaining about.

In his mind, he saw Kelly’s fiancé, ripped open and gutted, hanging from the trees. He was ready for that level of gore. As a pediatrician, he had, of course seen multiple grisly injuries so blood had never bothered him. It was the injuries that didn’t seem too bad at all but led to fatal results that had always bothered him: the kid that falls down two stairs at home and reports no real pain, only to die of a brain bleed two days later, or the kid that stayed underwater in the pool just a bit too long on Monday afternoon and did not wake up Tuesday morning.

At first, Bobby’s injuries seemed to be at that level. The ATV had honestly not struck him as badly as it had appeared from his little sapling perch ten feet above. The wheel well of the back rear tire was what had him pinned, and the handlebars had missed his face by about six inches. But Chris could tell that the large chunk of granite to the back was what had done most of the damage.

On his way to Chris, he also saw the rifle he had dropped in his fall. He didn’t grab it, but made sure to know exactly where it was. He then went over to Bobby and looked him in the face. He also saw the shotgun that Bobby had asked him to hold. It was a few feet away from the rock Chris was currently pinned to.

“Bobby, can you hear me?”

Bobby’s eyes were distant and fluttering. He nodded and let out a groan. “My back. And I…I can’t feel my right leg…I don’t…”

“Don’t talk right now. I just want you to nod or shake your head for a second. I can take the four-wheeler off of you, but I don’t know what it’s going to do. If your back is broken, moving it is going the pain much worse. Yes or no, do you want me to move it?”

Slowly, Bobby nodded.

Chris wasted no time. He grabbed the ATV by the handlebars, turning them slightly to the left to make sure the front right wheel did not hit Bobby in the face. When he had it off of Bobby’s chest, Bobby let out a tortured scream and then started to pant and wail. Chris had expected this; if his back was indeed broken, there were certain breaks and dislocations that would make it almost torturous to take in a moderate breath. His body sagged a bit against the rock, but it was acting as a support as well.

“Any chance you can feel that leg now?” Chris asked.

“No,” Bobby groaned. As he said this single word, a trickle of blood came out of his mouth and spilled over his bottom lip. In was a chilling sight to see as the first true light of dawn shone down on them.

“Okay…” Chris said, looking around and trying to formulate a plan. “Okay…what to do now?”

“Are you stupid?” Bobby said, grimacing at each word. “Get out of here.” It was obvious that each word was causing him horrendous pain. “Just let that thing have me and you get out of here.”

Chris wasn’t sure if he could do its. Sure, about twelve hours ago, it wouldn’t have been a question. But the four of them had all faced this traumatic experience together, and suddenly their individual rivalries and troubles seemed small and insignificant. And even if he did decide to try to escape, leaving Bobby behind while he went sprinting through the woods yet again, there was no guarantee he wouldn’t simply freeze to death in the forest. Aside from his own troubles in this hateful wilderness, he also had Bobby’s claim that the forests almost seemed to be alive—that they had moved around just to disorient them. He knew it sounded crazy, but in their current predicament, it seemed very possible indeed.

Chris went to the shotgun and propped it up against the hillside. He then went to the rifle they’d been carting around through the woods since this whole thing started. He picked it up and looked it over. He knew very little about guns and it took him about ten seconds to figure out how to tell how many rounds were loaded into it.

“Four shots,” he told Chris. “And like I said…the ammo is in the woods somewhere. I just didn’t—”

“I don’t think it would matter anyway,” Bobby said. “Now give me the shotgun.”

Chris didn’t like the idea at all, but he did as Bobby demanded. When he handed it to Bobby, he could tell that it took a lot of strength for him just to hold it up.

“One shot in this, I think,” Bobby said, wincing at each word. More blood came spilling out of his mouth. “Bear fired once. Hit it…but it didn’t do a damned thing.”

“Seriously,” Chris said. “Stop talking.”

“I will if you get out of here.”

“I can’t do that…”

“Don’t try to be a martyr,” Bobby spat through teeth clenched in pain. “After what I did to you…I deserve it. Don’t you dare stay here and die with me. Move your ass and get back home to your family.” Each word was laced in pain. and Bobby’s face was growing incredibly pale. Bobby was also starting to earnestly weep—whether from pain or emotion, Chris wasn’t sure.

“Bobby, your back is broken and you’re bleeding internally. You may be paralyzed from the waist down. But if we can figure out some way to—”

A sound from overhead interrupted him. Both men looked up and though the sight didn’t surprise Chris, it filled his heart with dread all the same.

The wendigo was coming down the side of the hill, scaling it with the practiced skill of something that knew the forest well.

The fact that it was taking its time, eyeing them as it descended, made the entire scene all the more terrifying. It was letting them know that it planned to take its time with them—that it was going to make sure their deaths were slow and that it was going to feed very well.`,

      content: `Seeing the beast in the soft morning light made it quite clear what they were dealing with. It was bizarre, really, because if Chris did not know what sort of danger and malice it was capable of, he would almost have felt sorry for it. It looked totally emaciated, its elongated ribs visible through its mottled skin. Its limbs, while long and grotesque, looked almost bent out of their proper position. The thing walked and climbed with an odd posture, likely the result of getting accustomed to moving around on those too-long limbs. Seeing its arms in the light of morning, Chris could now understand how he’d at first mistaken its shape in the dark as a living, breathing tree branch.

Chris raised the rifle, waiting for it to get closer. He was not familiar with guns and didn’t want to waste a single shot. He knew there was a risk of waiting until it got closer, but he was willing to take that risk if it meant planting a few rounds right in its oversized and misshapen head.

And oh God, it’s head. Its face looked almost like that of a man, except for a few slanted features that resembled a deer, particularly the snout. The lips were stretched too far across that they were little more than forgotten pencil lines buried in the skin. The jaw looked so triangular at the bottom that he wondered how it could open its mouth wide enough to let out its God-awful screams. A pair of jagged antlers clung to its head. They looked just as deformed as its face, not quite standing straight and as crooked as a downed tree.

As it climbed down, it regarded both men with those human-like eyes and as they landed on Bobby, a sudden thought occurred to Chris.

These guns may not be much help, he thought. If Bear did shoot it with a round and it sees that same gun and is still coming, it means it’s not afraid of it. With this thought, Chris thought he could see where Bear had blasted it. There was a ragged tear along its left side and there was fresh blood coming out of it. But the thing didn’t move as if the wound was bothering it at all.

When the wendigo was about two feet off of the slanted hill, Chris readied himself. He took aim and fired. The shot took the creature low in the jaw. It howled for a moment, but didn’t stagger at all. Instead, it came racing for Chris with a speed that was so unexpected that Chris struggled to make sense of it. By the time his finger was on the trigger to pull the second shot off, it was right in front of him. Chris got the shot off and actually saw it tear a hole high up in its chest as he scrambled back. But the wendigo took it as if it were nothing.

It grabbed the barrel of the rifle and tore it out of Chris’s hands. Chris tried to fight with it to keep the gun in his clutches, but the sheer strength behind those thin arms was beyond comprehension. Not only did the wendigo tear the weapon from his hand, but it nearly pulled Chris towards it at the same time.

Chris saw the spot where his first shot had taken it in the jaw. The thin lips were red and swollen and there was a walnut sized hole in its face. It, like the wound in its left side, bled freely, but it didn’t seem to bother the monster all that much.

With the rifle in hand, the wendigo threw it hard to the side. It pinwheeled past the wrecked ATV and crashed into the trees to Bobby’s right. The wendigo’s gaze landed on Bobby and it cocked its head as if considering something. Chris watched as Bobby did his absolute best to keep his composure. He stared right back at the beast and though his eyes were filled with tears and fear, he clutched the shotgun and never looked away as the monster advanced.

Chris looked around for something, for anything. The best he could come up with was a rock about the size of a football. He picked it up and lobbed it at the wendigo. It struck the creature in its back, the knobs of its spine just as well-defined through its skin as its ribs. It wheeled around on him with its lips pulled back in a sneer, revealing teeth that looked like jagged pieces of granite.

“It was just a rock, you freak!” Bobby yelled. “Look at me! At me, that’s right?! I got away from you before, didn’t I? Don’t you ignore me, you gangly-legged bitch!”

He then leveled the shotgun at the wendigo and sneered.

The wendigo turned its attention solely back to Bobby, a growl like thunder coming out of its throat. It took one quick stride in his direction and then Bobby did something that surprised both the wendigo and Chris.

Bobby held on to the shotgun with his right hand and used his left to show the wendigo his middle finger. He then smiled, reclaimed the shotgun with both hands, and placed it under his own chin.

Chris knew what was coming, so he finally did as Bobby had been begging him to do. At about the same time Bobby Valencia pulled the trigger and ended his own life, Chris took off running.

He hurried, but not fast enough to be amazed at how loud the blast was. It seemed to echo in his head as it tore across the forest like thunder.

Chris never looked back. Part of him knew it was foolish to even think he could get away, but he went running all the same. He ran in the opposite direction of the hill and the trail, returning to the all too familiar scenery of the woods. Branches slapped him in the face and his feet struck downed logs and stumps. He had fallen twice by the time he heard the wendigo behind him, uttering a deep roar that Chris could feel in his bones.

But he continued to run, and he did not stop until he could feel the footsteps of the wendigo behind him, and its hot, rancid breath on his neck.`,

      content: `The weight of the wendigo was very misleading.

When it pinned Chris to the ground, the force of its strength was massive. But when its full body was on him, gripping Chris to roll him over onto his back, it felt like nothing more than a weighted blanket. Its hands, though, were persistent. When they dug into Chris’s sides, he felt its claws piercing through his coat and layers of clothing. He felt it the moment those claws dug deep into his skin, and when the skin was ripped back as it rolled him over.

Chris tried to scream but, it was suddenly impossible to breathe. There was too much pain, too much fear. It was as if the wendigo was stealing his breath right out of his chest.

The creature perched over him with a knobby knee planted in Chris’s chest. For a moment, they were eye to eye, their brows about six inches apart. The eyes Chris found himself looking into were unmistakably human but there was a sort of fog there, the sort of look someone might get when they zone out while looking out of a train window, or when considering a question that’s too difficult to comprehend.

Its face was smeared in red and flesh-colored bits. Chris knew this was the remnants of whatever meal it had taken out of Bobby—or maybe even Bear or Noah. He could smell the rancid reek of death on its breath. The blood on its lips and pointed chin were so fresh that Chris could smell the copper-like scent of it. But there was a woodland smell there, too—something like dead trees, stagnant water and dead animals gone to rot.

To Chris’s shock, the thing started sniffing at him. It was definitely sizing him up, making Chris wonder if it was simply toying with him. Was it expecting another chase through the woods? If so, it was sorely mistaken.

Chris tried to free himself from the thing’s grip, but it was useless. His hands slapped out at the ground, looking for a branch or rock or something to hit it with, but there was nothing. The wendigo kept him pinned there with its knee and then, when it was done sniffing, it started to slide its massive, callused hand down Chris’s face. The fingers then traced down the side of his neck and Chris was sure the thing would just tear his throat out, but it did no such thing. In fact, as the wendigo continued to search Chris with its hand, it did so as if selecting a ripe piece of fruit.

When it was done, it slowly released the pressure of its knee. Chris tried to get away at once, but the wendigo’s hand was instantly at his throat again. This time, the monster lifted him from the ground and held him firmly against a nearby tree. It growled at him and narrowed its small eyes.

“Do it,” Chris said, barely managing the words through his tightening throat. “Just do it…please…”

The wendigo looked all around them, taking in the trees and the brightening morning sky. It then let out a shriek that didn’t seem to have much anger or hurt to it. Chris thought it almost sounded as if it was calling out, trying to get the attention of someone or something. The idea that there might be more than one of them sent a spike of panic through Chris that he didn’t think he was going to control. For a moment, he thought he had lost control of his bladder and he felt that now-familiar slippage in his mind. He wondered if this might be what it was like to lose your mind, to feel rationality and common-sense slip away.

The wendigo, getting no response, turned back to Chris. Then, with its uncanny speed, it took Chris’s left hand in its own. Chris again felt as if he were being inspected and wondered if it gave this same sort of consideration to each of his victims. Was he going to get lucky and perhaps have this fabled monster decide that there was something wrong with him and that he was not worth killing and devouring?

The answer came quickly and when it did, Chris accepted it with about as much tact as a man staring death directly in the face could manage. The wendigo swiftly drew its face closer to Chris’s hand, opened its mouth, and placed his pointer and middle fingers inside. It snapped down hard, those jagged rock-like teeth gnashing against flesh and bone. It all happened fast and Chris wasn’t even fully aware of what had happened until blood started to flow.

He screamed. The first shock of pain came in the snapping of the bones in his fingers. The next sharp stabbing of pain came like an electric surge as he felt his pointer finger gnawed cleanly off. The pain was immense and he writhed against the grip of the wendigo as it continued to press him firmly against the tree.

The middle finger went next. This one was a bit more stubborn, and he felt the teeth having to grind against the last bit of skin and sinew before it came cleanly away. Chris’s screams became quick, hitching sobs. His breath came in the same way and for a moment, he thought he was going to hyperventilate. He started to pray that he would pass out so he wouldn’t experience the rest.

But to his surprise, the wendigo finally released him and when Chris hit the ground, he collapsed. His hand was rotating through a strange cycle of excruciating pain one moment, and then a dull sort of throbbing the next. Blood was cascading onto the cold forest floor and he felt himself quickly reaching the verge of passing out.

The wendigo stood over him and Chris opened his mouth, wanting to will the thing to just kill him. But when he opened his mouth, all that came out was a primal sound—a combination of a painful wail and a scream of absolute rage. The wendigo did not respond. It just stood over him for a moment, making no movements or sounds.

Chris crawled towards it, thinking that if he antagonized it, maybe it would finally deliver that killing blow. He reached its leg but couldn’t will himself to look up at it. His gnarled hand bled on its misshapen feet and, as strange as it seemed, the wendigo seemed to make a sound of pity.

Chris tried once more to pull himself up, but it only resulted in a release of his strength and nothing more. He fell to the forest floor, his cheek on the cold ground and his breath coming out in tired little vapors. He waited for the killing blow, but it never came. Slowly, the world grew dark and the last thing he saw before he slipped into unconsciousness was the feet of the wendigo moving away. And for a hectic moment, Chris’s puzzled eyes seem to think the very forest itself was moving with it.`,

      content: `He was flying over the forest again. There was no snow, no ice, no chill. Maupin Lake and all the little creeks that fed into it flowed freely, and there were innumerable shades of green on the trees. The air was rich with the smell of firs and pines, and all manner of wildlife ran beneath the green canopy.

Slowly, he began to descend into the trees. He did not feel the needles as he passed beyond the umbrella of firs, but he smelled it and felt their presence all around him. He spotted an owl, nested and asleep within an old elm, and a family of foxes whirling about their den. He knew them all well and when he passed by them, they regarded him with a quick look over their furry shoulders. They then hurried inside the den, as if spooked by something in the air.

He sank down further still, now among the dirt, moss, and the rotting dead foliage. It smelled like earth and death and life all at once. He greeted the beetles, the worms, the spiders, and grubs. He felt the earth under his touch and knew that if he wanted, he could sink even deeper. If he wanted, he could go beneath the soil and grass to mingle with the roots of trees and the cold, burrowed shapes of animals waiting for warner days.

Instead, he remained on the ground and took it all in. This world was his—each creature, each smell, each little mote of dust that danced and swirled on the rays of golden sunlight that spilled onto the forest floor. And for now, he would simply enjoy it. He raised back to get a bird’s-eye view again. He watched the evening sun dance off of the lake and he could sense, somewhere down below, something familiar but nearly forgotten.

At dusk, a staggering figure made its way across the front lawn of a cabin that had been rented out by Noah Miller, Bobby Valencia, Barret Thompson, and Chris Ramsey. The SUV they had arrived in remained in the snowed-over driveway. The hood was still partially up, and half of a dead fox remained inside. The lawn and cabin were quiet, the entire scene disrupted only by the cries of a few cautious loons somewhere behind the cabin, around the rim of the lake.

The figure pushed the front door open, left unlocked by the four hurried men who had rushed outside roughly thirty-two hours before. The interior showed signs of their residence—beer cans, a few scattered pieces of clothes, books, food. But the trespasser had no interest in any of this. Instead, it walked to the bedroom on the right side of the central living area. The door was ajar, and the figure pushed it open.

A bed sat against the far wall, small and unmade. More scattered clothes were on the edge of the bed. A small pack lay on the floor with a few other belongings, but this also went totally ignored.

The figure approached the head of the bed, where the bedside table sat. An old, battered wallet sat on the edge. The intruder picked it up and thumbed through it for a moment. Tucked away in one of the folds were two pictures. One showed a smiling woman and a little girl. The girl was laughing, her bright eyes wide and alive, her mouth opened in a monumental laugh.

The second picture showed the same little girl with a man—a man that looked hauntingly familiar. The figure eyed the man and the little girl and when it opened its mouth, a strange sound came out of its throat. A sound like someone walking through mud.

The intruder thought it might have been a sound it had known once.

“Brianna.”

Tears came out of the figure’s small eyes, and it didn’t know why. It regarded the pictures for a moment longer and then placed them back into the folds of the wallet—a task made quite tricky being that its left hand was missing the first two fingers.

It made its way back out through the cabin and into the afternoon light. Dusk was on its way and soon the bitter cold of night would overtake the forest. The figure walked into the trees on legs it was not yet accustomed to. Though he felt unsteady in this new form, it felt that the trees and the forest all around would hold him up and support him.

He felt that it was all alive, and it was here for him. He could feel the breathing presence of every tree, every animal, every insect.

He thought of that sound one more time as he disappeared into the forest.

Brianna.

The word went falling down the dark tunnels of his mind like a coin tossed into a well, pinging off the sides and making music along the way, but ultimately eaten by the dark.

And with it, every other piece of the humanity he’d once known.`,

Your flesh shall become twisted and your bones gnarled.

At the proper age, Drakenblud, the ancient blood of dragons, is bestowed as a gift upon royalty. The mysterious substance grants those who consume it godlike traits in order to make them more perfect rulers.

Ulrin Emberlind is the next member of the noble Emberlind family to inherit the Gift of the Blood. However, on the day of his ceremony, some of the highly guarded Drakenblud is stolen, and the King seems overcome with anger.

Then, the Bleeding occurs.

When ominous crimson clouds gather over the castle, those in Lorne who have partaken in the Drakenblud suddenly change. Their bodies twist and disfigure into violent, voracious monsters known as the Corrupted. Ulrin’s father, the King, changes, too, and commits the unthinkable upon his own family.

Five years later, survivors struggle to remain unnoticed by the Corrupted. The land lies in ruins. And Ulrin has set his eyes on revenge against the Malformed King. He sets out to save his Kingdom and understand what truly caused The Bleeding.
