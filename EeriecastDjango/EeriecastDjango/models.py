# All models are now in:
# - apps/authentication/models.py (User model)
# - apps/podcasts/models.py (Podcast model)
# - apps/categories/models.py (Category model)
# - apps/creators/models.py (Creator model)
# - apps/episodes/models.py (Episode model)
# - apps/library/models.py (User interaction models)
#
# If you need any of the old models, they should be migrated to the appropriate app
